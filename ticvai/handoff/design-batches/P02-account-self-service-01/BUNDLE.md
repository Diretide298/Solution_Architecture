## Who this is for

**guest on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 6 permissions apply here:
  `GUEST_MANAGE, GUEST_VIEW, GUEST_VIEW_PII, LEDGER_POST, LEDGER_VIEW, ORDER_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **5 of these operations work offline**: getEntitlement, getGuestSession, getOrder, listMyEntitlements, listOrders
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GST-012` | My Tickets | A | 7 | 55 | 6 | 7 | 10 | 0 | guest | notStarted (client-verified) |

| `GST-045` | Ticket Delivery & Sharing | A | 8 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 0 | guest | notStarted (client-verified) |
| `GST-055` | Dynamic QR Ticket | A | 13 | 38 | 5 | 7 | 10 | 0 | guest | notStarted (client-verified) |
| `GST-066` | Privacy & My Data | A | 12 | 2 | 6 | 16 | 2 | 4 | guest | notStarted (designed) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**GST-020 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Account & Self-Service · wave 1 · needs the `access` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #17972 (APP-MOB-GST-012) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `listMyEntitlements` reads the population and `getEntitlement` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** Tickets already loaded stay visible with their age, and a ticket's rotating code is derived on the device from its seed, so it changes with no signal (decided 28 September, audit R230). Sharing, transferring and adding to a phone wallet need the connection. |
| Opens with | `entitlementId` (deepLink), `orderId` (deepLink) · cold entry: **A ticket link opened after the event.** Shows the entitlement with its status — expired, used, transferred — because *not found* to somebody holding a ticket … |
| Route | `/general/my-tickets` |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. My Tickets. **Declared only `transferOrderTickets` until 20 August** — a guest could give a ticket away and could not read one. Raised by Pranay. **Rewired on the 20 August review.** **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added getEntitlementCredential, getEntitlementHistory, listEntitlements. **The same screen on web and app was calling different operations** — one side could do something the other could not, and nothing recorded the difference as deliberate. **Mobile v4 (decided 29 September, MOB-1, MOB-7).** The **Tickets** tab root. GST-013 Ticket Details and GST-055 Dynamic QR Ticket (refresh every 30 s) are unchanged.

**Known gaps.** **`getEntitlementCredential` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape. **`getEntitlementHistory` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transfer order tickets (primary button) | `transferOrderTickets` POST `/orders/{orderId}/transfer` | inline | TicketTransfer | 409 Ticket already redeemed (`alreadyRedeemed`), already offered (`alreadyOffered`), or the product forbids transfer (`transferNotAllowed`). (TicketTransferProblem) | opens modal first; produces a document or message: Transfer tickets to another guest |

**Data it reads**: `listMyEntitlements` (onLoad, Every ticket, pass and membership this guest holds); `getEntitlement` (onLoad, One entitlement, with what remains on it); `getEntitlementCredential` (onLoad, The thing that gets scanned); `getEntitlementHistory` (onLoad, Every scan, freeze, share and reissue against it); `listEntitlements` (onLoad, Every entitlement this guest holds, including expired)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `GST-013` Ticket Details: *They open the one for now*; carries `entitlementId`, `orderId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The tickets list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the tickets untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No tickets yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches the filter on state, includeShared and the tickets are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `listMyEntitlements` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** Tickets already loaded stay visible with their age, and a ticket's rotating code is derived on the device from its seed, so it changes with no signal (decided 28 September, audit R230). Sharing, transferring and adding to a phone wallet need the connection. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 Ticket already redeemed (`alreadyRedeemed`), already offered (`alreadyOffered`), or the product forbids transfer (`transferNotAllowed`). (TicketTransferProblem) |

#### Permissions

- `listMyEntitlements` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `getEntitlement` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `transferOrderTickets` → no permission · guest
- `getEntitlementCredential` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `getEntitlementHistory` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `listEntitlements` → no permission · guest

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `listMyEntitlements` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

7 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19.2.13 | Ticket Transfer - System shall support ticket transfers. | Guest Mobile App & Branding | CONTRACTED | `transferOrderTickets` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Tickets tab: purchased tickets with a scan code (dynamic QR refreshing every 30 s), add to wallet or calendar, send/share, refund or resale. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tickets and scan · DI-1083)*
- Tickets tab shows the guest's purchased tickets and their scan code. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1022)*
- Entitlement statuses: active, reserved, consumed, transferred, expired, refunded/cancelled; views show entitlements nearing expiry, real-time consumption per customer, and whether a ticket has been upgraded. *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 / 4.11 Entitlements Lifecycle & Usage · DI-670)*
- Family/dependent view shows a family ticket's composition (e.g. two adults, two children) with each dependent's entitlements; equivalent views for school and corporate bookings. *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.9 Entitlements Portfolio - Structure, Family/Group & Assignment · DI-668)*
- Entitlements portfolio is used both by the guest (mobile app) and by customer service: one view of restrictions, wallet balance and all entitlements; a unified list across a visit (e.g. four admissions, two fast passes, a meal package, a parking entitlement). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.9 Entitlements Portfolio - Structure, Family/Group & Assignment · DI-667)*
- Any online purchase for a dynamic-QR event must be linked to the mobile app to show the working code; web/desktop purchases are redirected into the app for activation, not exempted. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.7 Confirmed (Pradnya's question) · DI-635)*
- Upgrades must be available in the guest mobile/web app: guests view eligible upgrade options and complete the upgrade online without visiting on-site. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.9 / 5. Key Decisions · DI-606)*
- Decision: deferred seat assignment — sale confirmed at purchase as section + quantity; seats allocated internally; closer to the event ops/admin trigger a bulk e-mail issuing QR tickets with final seats. Immediate seat assignment remains for venues that need it. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.7 Deferred Seat Assignment Model; 5. Key Decisions · DI-423)*
- Group bookings: one shared QR for the whole group (redeemed together at the counter) or one QR per person, each of which the guest can link to their own profile in the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 6. Food & Beverage — Ordering, Delivery, and Redemption · DI-289)*
- Guest profile shows gift vouchers and a stored-value "money card"/wallet; "My Tickets" (all tickets) is separate from "My Reservations" (bookings holding one or more tickets) with reservation details and date modification. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-199)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### References

- Wireframe frame: `wireframes/P02 Guest App.dc.html#gst-012` · status **notStarted** · provenance client-verified

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (7), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (404, 409).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (55 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-012?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Transfer order tickets.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `GST-013`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 10 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. Ticket Details. **The credential is a separate call** — a list of tickets is a convenience and the credential admits somebody. **Rewired on the 20 August review.** **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Ticket tags from `Product.displayTags` when `ticketTags` is on (23SEP-3).

**Known gaps.** **`getEntitlementCredential` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape. **`getEntitlementHistory` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

**Entitlement credential** (detail panel, from `getEntitlementCredential`): Shows `mediaCode`, `payload`, `expiresAt` from `getEntitlementCredential`'s inline response. **The response has no named schema**, so this cannot bind until the contract names one. **A rotating code derived on the device** (decided 28 September, audit R230): while online the screen fetches `rotation` (secret, `timeStepSeconds`, `digits`, `algorithm`, valid `validFrom` to `validTo`) and computes …

**Entitlement history** (data table, from `getEntitlementHistory`): Shows `at`, `kind`, `accessPointName`, `denyReason`, `byPrincipalName` from `getEntitlementHistory`'s inline response. **The response has no named schema**, so this cannot bind until the contract names one.

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `GST-055` Dynamic QR Ticket: *The QR rotates as they walk to the gate*; carries `credentialId`, `entitlementId`, `orderId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Availability is live, never cached |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Availability unavailable. **Selection is blocked** — overselling is worse than waiting |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Sold out is a real answer.** Offers the next available rather than a dead end |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `getEntitlement` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** Tickets already loaded stay visible with their age, and a ticket's rotating code is derived on the device from its seed, so it changes with no signal (decided 28 September, audit R230). Sharing, transferring and adding to a phone wallet need the connection. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 Ticket already redeemed (`alreadyRedeemed`), already offered (`alreadyOffered`), or the product forbids transfer (`transferNotAllowed`). (TicketTransferProblem); 409 `device-limit` or `device-change-needs-approval` under the venue's device binding policy. |

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `getEntitlement` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

7 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19.2.13 | Ticket Transfer - System shall support ticket transfers. | Guest Mobile App & Branding | CONTRACTED | `transferOrderTickets` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Tickets tab: purchased tickets with a scan code (dynamic QR refreshing every 30 s), add to wallet or calendar, send/share, refund or resale. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tickets and scan · DI-1083)*
- Ticket cards, Read more and the listing side panel show tags (e.g. "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Free adult entry", "Valid 90 days", "Emirates ID"), each with a kind icon (clock, height, free, calendar, id), max 6. Venue-set tags win, else derived from duration, validity, height rule. Setting "Tags on tickets", default on. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 3. 'Read more' should carry tags customisable per ticket type · DI-1025)*
- Entitlement statuses: active, reserved, consumed, transferred, expired, refunded/cancelled; views show entitlements nearing expiry, real-time consumption per customer, and whether a ticket has been upgraded. *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 / 4.11 Entitlements Lifecycle & Usage · DI-670)*
- Family/dependent view shows a family ticket's composition (e.g. two adults, two children) with each dependent's entitlements; equivalent views for school and corporate bookings. *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.9 Entitlements Portfolio - Structure, Family/Group & Assignment · DI-668)*
- A ticket is always one virtual record; QR, RFID, NFC, face and future credentials (e.g. hotel room key, city transit card) are interchangeable media linked to it. Screens should show one ticket with its linked media, not separate tickets per medium. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 5. Key Decisions & Agreements · DI-652)*
- **Open question.** Open: NFC inside a wallet pass needs Apple certification (works with any reader) vs HID SDK on the guest phone (likely HID readers only). QR-based wallet passes are straightforward. Chinmay leans to direct Apple certification unless it is a hard blocker. *(open · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.10 Media & Credentials (QR, RFID, NFC & Wallets) · DI-610)*
- Apple/Google Wallet configuration covers template design (background colour, header, footer) and the guest-facing "Add to Apple Wallet" flow after an online purchase. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.10 Media & Credentials (QR, RFID, NFC & Wallets) · DI-609)*
- Upgrades must be available in the guest mobile/web app: guests view eligible upgrade options and complete the upgrade online without visiting on-site. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.9 / 5. Key Decisions · DI-606)*
- Staff can upgrade multiple tickets in one action. "Quick upgrade" is a direct single-path upgrade (gold > platinum); "flexible upgrade" lets the guest choose among several eligible targets. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.9 Ticket Upgrade & Downgrade Configuration · DI-605)*
- Qossai: where a waiver is required before entry, an incomplete waiver can block ticket download, activation, check-in or access; ticket and scan screens need a waiver-incomplete state. *(agreed · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-574)*
- Decision (raised by Chinmay): date-change/reschedule is a product-level on/off setting with its own policy rules (e.g. allowed up to 24 hours before the visit, denied within 24 hours), not a separate screen. Typically off for special-day tickets (e.g. New Year, 1 January only), on for standard GA. *(agreed · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.3 Ticket Type Deep-Dive; 5. Key Decisions · DI-446)*
- Decision: deferred seat assignment — sale confirmed at purchase as section + quantity; seats allocated internally; closer to the event ops/admin trigger a bulk e-mail issuing QR tickets with final seats. Immediate seat assignment remains for venues that need it. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.7 Deferred Seat Assignment Model; 5. Key Decisions · DI-423)*
- Ticket + combo meal: one QR holds both admission and meal; scanned at entry and again at the F&B counter to redeem the meal; a second meal redemption is refused. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 6. Food & Beverage — Ordering, Delivery, and Redemption · DI-287)*
- Dynamic QR: the ticket QR is non-scannable until the guest is on site, then activates and refreshes continuously to prevent misuse (reconfirmed). *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.9 "Plan Your Adventure" (Itinerary Planner) · DI-219)*
- Ticket PDF carries a live QR code, a unique ticket number/barcode (media identifier), customisable branding/layout, terms and conditions and guest name; screens must distinguish ticket ID (one per ticket) from media code (can cover several tickets scanned as one group). *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 20. Live Point-of-Sale Transaction Walkthrough · DI-180)*
- The ticket QR code regenerates every 15-30 seconds (configurable). *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 7. Ticket Validation & Offline Architecture · DI-064)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Booking settings (tenant, with per-venue overrides)*, set in `CMS-016` Site Settings:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ticket tags (`bookingFlow.ticketTags`) | — | on | Tags on tickets (decided 29 September, rev 3 23SEP-3). Shows a product's display tags (such as "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Valid 90 days") on its card. |
| Settings: ticket tags (`bookingFlow.venueOverrides[].settings.ticketTags`) | — | on | Tags on tickets (decided 29 September, rev 3 23SEP-3). Shows a product's display tags (such as "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Valid 90 days") on its card. |

#### References

- Wireframe frame: `wireframes/P02 Guest App.dc.html#gst-013` · status **notStarted** · provenance client-verified
- Prototype (rev 3, verified 2026-09-28, match exact): `sources/designs/guest-rev3-28-september/TICVAI Guest Booking Mobile v2.dc.html`, view *Account → All screens → Wave 1 → Ticket details*. Differences: The YAML states come from an availability template ("Sold out is a real answer") and do not fit a ticket-detail screen.
- Flow F50 *A guest arrives, parks, and gets in*, step 5: They open the one for now. → **The credential, not the ticket.** What a gate reads is a rotating credential — and the history is what answers *has this been used*.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (10), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (31 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-013?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Transfer order tickets, Bind credential device.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `GST-055`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 16 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

#### Requirements it meets

9 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Add bookings to Apple/Google/Outlook calendar with reminders; wishlist of F&B and retail items to buy later on-site. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-202)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Footer*, set in `CMS-007` Page Builder:

Also set there, as content the tenant writes: social links: platform.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (11), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409, 412).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (40 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-018?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Issue wallet pass, Download order calendar event, Save visit reminder.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 1 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. Order History. **`transferOrderTickets` was the only declared operation**, which is not history. Raised by Pranay. **Rewired on the 20 August review.** **`listMyOrders` wired 24 August, raised in review.** The staff-scoped list was on this guest screen — **a guest-facing list must be scoped to the caller, not filtered by a subject parameter**, or a guest is one parameter away from somebody else’s. **Renamed 31 August** from *Order History (Wallet)*. **A guest surface is one product with two renderings** — a screen named differently on web and app is two screens to a developer and one journey to a guest. **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added transferOrderTickets. **A guest does not know which surface they are on** — the same named screen on web and app now calls the same guest-callable operations.

### `GST-020` Saved Items / Wishlist

**Find the right one quickly, and act on it without opening it.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Account & Self-Service · wave 3 · needs the `marketing` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #18219 (APP-MOB-GST-020) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | statusTracker (comfortable density): `getWishlist` reads one record and nothing reads a population — the screen is about that one thing |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Opens with | `itemId` (deepLink), `subjectId` (GST-001) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared ticket, a forwarded confirmation … |
| Route | `/general/saved-items-wishlist` |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. Wishlist. **Device and consent operations removed 20 August** — Pranay asked why they were here, and the answer is that seven operations were attached in bulk to three unrelated screens. **Rewired on the 20 August review.**

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Form: Add to wishlist** (modal, opened by *Add to wishlist*; *Add to wishlist* calls `addToWishlist`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `addToWishlist` sends before it is called.** Required: `variantId`. Optional: `performanceId`, `note`. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Variant `variantId` | picker: choose a variant | required | — | — | shows names, sends the id | — | `addToWishlist` body |
| Performance `performanceId` | picker: choose a performance | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | Saving a specific date rather than the product generally. | `addToWishlist` body |
| Note `note` | text area | optional | — | max length 200 | — | — | `addToWishlist` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 404 Variant not found or not sellable in this venue

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**The wishlist** (detail panel, from `getWishlist`)

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Items | list or chips (count when long) | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add to wishlist (primary button) | `addToWishlist` POST `/guests/{subjectId}/wishlist` | inline | Wishlist | 404 Variant not found or not sellable in this venue | opens modal first |
| Remove from wishlist (destructive button) | `removeFromWishlist` DELETE `/guests/{subjectId}/wishlist/{itemId}` | — | — | 404 The resource does not exist, or is outside the caller's scope. This includes a parent in the path. | — |

**Data it reads**: `getWishlist` (onLoad, Read a guest's saved items)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*

**What opens over it**

- confirmDialog *Remove from wishlist*: **Names what `removeFromWishlist` changes and what it leaves alone**, in the consequence rather than the verb. A saved items wishlist this affects should be identified in the dialog, not just counted.

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The saved items wishlist, read by `getWishlist`. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the saved items wishlist untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No saved items wishlist yet. Offers Add to wishlist (`addToWishlist`). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |

#### Permissions

- `getWishlist` → no permission · guest
- `addToWishlist` → no permission · guest

| Subject | the name it points at, never the id | Opaque reference. Personal data lives in the separately erasable store, which is what makes erasure possible against an append-only ledger. |

| Tags | list or chips (count when long) | — |
| Engagement score | 1,234 | 22.2.20 and 22.2.21. `lifetimeValue` and `visitCount` existed, so value was a stored figure and engagement was not. |
| Engagement tier | chip: New, Active, Occasional, Lapsing, Lapsed, Dormant | 5.3.19. Automatic classification, computed rather than assigned. |

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The saved profile. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the profile untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No profile configured. The form opens empty and `recordConsent` saves the first one; it says what the platform does in the meantime. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `GUEST_VIEW`, which `updateMyProfile` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Notice version unknown, or the purpose is not configured |

#### Permissions

- `recordConsent` → no permission · guest
- `updateMyProfile` → `GUEST_VIEW` (read) · guest

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `GUEST_VIEW`, which `updateMyProfile` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. **Corrected 24 August**: removed getCurrentSession, logout, selectRole. **A guest surface has no roles to select and its own logout.** `selectRole` is ADR-0002 staff authorisation; `getCurrentSession` is the staff session. `guestLogout` and `getGuestSession` already existed — the screen was reaching into the staff identity surface because nothing checked that a guest platform only calls guest operations. **Rebuilt 28 September as a guest sign-in form** (decided 28 September, audit R167, R073 (a)): removed `login`, `startSsoAuthorization`, `completeSsoAuthorization`, `listSsoProviders` and the six MFA operations — guests have no enterprise SSO. **The second factor came back on 29 September, per venue** (see below). Password sign-in is `guestPasswordLogin`. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** **Guest two-step verification is per venue, off by default** (GAP-B1, `VenueSettings.identity.guestTwoStep`; supersedes the second part of audit R167; no enterprise SSO stands). The prompt appears only when signing in or acting at a venue that has it on; enrolment is on the guest's account (GST-073). **Sign-in gate (REV3-3):** reached from GST-008 (after add-ons) or GST-041 (at payment), returning to the basket with it kept; guest checkout and matching unchanged (DG-1). **The venue in context is sent** (decided 29 September, rev 3 GAP-B1, per venue): `verifyGuestOtp`, `guestPasswordLogin`, `guestSocialLogin` …

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Who is signed in on this device** (detail panel, from `getGuestSession`): Shown only when a guest session already exists on this device, with a way to sign out so a shared device is handed over clean.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Display name | text | — |
| Is verified | yes / no (icon or chip) | False until an OTP or a verified provider identity confirms ownership. An unverified account may browse and fill a cart but not transact … |
| Identity providers | list or chips (count when long) | Linked providers. Several may resolve to one account. |
| Preferred language | text | — |
| Expires at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | 30 days, sliding (decided 28 September, audit R126 (2)): each use of the session moves this to 30 days from now, and 30 days unused ends it. |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Data it reads**: `getGuestSession` (onLoad, Read the current guest session)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `GST-041` Checkout Entry: *Signed in and verified — back to the cart*; carries `cartId`; only when arrived from the cart
- → `WEB-016` Login / Register: *A guest who checked out anonymously links their order*; carries `challengeId`, `subjectId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Checking whether this device already holds a guest session. The sign-in form stays visible. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Identity could not be reached. **Says so rather than saying the password or code is wrong**, and keeps what was typed. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Nobody signed in on this device** — the normal state. The form offers a code, a password, Apple or Google and UAE Pass, and Create an account (`registerGuest`). |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025), and this is the screen a guest who is not signed in is sent to, so it has no no-access case of its own. A session that has expired lands here with the screen it came from kept, and returns to it after sign-in. |
| Sign in refused (`?state=signInRefused`) | **One message for every refusal of a password sign-in**: `guestPasswordLogin` answers 401 alike for a wrong password, an unknown identifier, an account with no password and a locked account, and the screen never says which. Too many attempts (429, or the lockout after `PasswordPolicy.lockoutAfterAttempts`) says to try again later and offers **Send me a code** instead (decided 28 September, audit R073 (a)). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **Not available, and the offline banner says why.** Signing in, registering and verifying a code need the server. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 Identifier already registered. Deliberately indistinguishable in timing from success — a registration endpoint that reveals which addresses exist is an account …; 409 The key is already claimed by another subject (`already-claimed`) |

#### Permissions

- `registerGuest` → no permission · anonymous
- `getGuestSession` → no permission · guest
- `guestLogout` → no permission · guest
- `guestPasswordLogin` → no permission · anonymous
- `guestSocialLogin` → no permission · anonymous
- `guestUaePassLogin` → no permission · anonymous
- `linkGuestCheckout` → no permission · guest
- `refreshToken` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `requestGuestOtp` → no permission · anonymous
- `verifyGuestOtp` → no permission · anonymous
- `createMfaChallenge` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `verifyMfaChallenge` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `claimDeviceConsent` → no permission · guest

**A refused user sees:** **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025), and this is the screen a guest who is not signed in is sent to, so it has no no-access case of its own. A session that has expired lands here with the screen it came from kept, and returns to it after sign-in.

#### Requirements it meets

13 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Sign-in (or the guest code when guest checkout is on) is asked when the guest leaves the Add-ons step; the basket is kept. Setting "Ask to sign in": After add-ons (default) or At payment. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-3 · 3. The sign-in screen should appear after Add-ons · DI-1043)*
- After the code, a match prompt shows what matched (e.g. 4 past orders, first order 12 Mar 2024, profile type), never the other profile's name or details, with "Use this profile" / "Not me – keep separate". Expired state: "This match has expired – continue as a new guest." *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, 1. Guest checkout, code proof, profile matching (WEB-012) · DI-1035)*
- Guest checkout is a venue toggle, off by default: off = sign-in screen at payment ("This venue requires an account for checkout. Your basket is kept."), guest button hidden. On = "Continue as guest" with email or mobile (per "Match returning guests by") and a code; only exactly six digits accepted, copy says six. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, 1. Guest checkout, code proof, profile matching (WEB-012) · DI-1034)*
- The guest-checkout email pop-up collects only the fields configured in the back end (email, phone and/or name). After the code is verified, do not ask for name/email/phone again: go straight to T&Cs and complete the booking; profile is created and can be completed later (Platinumlist pattern). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W1 Guest checkout · DI-1002)*
- Decision: at least one of e-mail or mobile number is mandatory at profile creation (not both — some customers decline e-mail); the system supports conditional "either/or" mandatory-field rules. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.1 CRM; 5. Key Decisions · DI-372)*
- Sign-up by phone number or email, verified by OTP (WhatsApp or SMS/email as configured), then minimal profile (first/last name). *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-209)*
- UAE Pass login: customer enters mobile number, approves a push notification, confirms with biometrics; verified personal details are pulled into the booking automatically and a linked account is created. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-123)*
- Checkout supports guest checkout, registered-account checkout, and single sign-on (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, a ticketing-specific SSO). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-121)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Booking settings (tenant, with per-venue overrides)*, set in `CMS-016` Site Settings:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Guest contact fields (`bookingFlow.guestContactFields`) | Email · Mobile · Name; at least 1; at most 3; no duplicates; Must include the contact the guest's code is sent to and matched on (identity `GuestMatchPolicy.; matchBy`), or 400. | Email | What the guest-checkout pop-up asks, and nothing else (decided 29 September, W1). |
| Settings: guest contact fields (`bookingFlow.venueOverrides[].settings.guestContactFields`) | Email · Mobile · Name; at least 1; at most 3; no duplicates; Must include the contact the guest's code is sent to and matched on (identity `GuestMatchPolicy.; matchBy`), or 400. | Email | What the guest-checkout pop-up asks, and nothing else (decided 29 September, W1). |

*Cookie banner*, set in `CMS-026` Cookie Banner & Preference Center Designer:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buttons: action (`cookieBanner.buttons[].action`) | Accept all · Reject non essential · Manage preferences · Save preferences · Do not sell or share | — | — |

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (36), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (6 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-042?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, signInRefused, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Send me a code, Sign in with the code, Sign in with password, Continue with Apple or Google, Continue with UAE Pass, Create an account, Sign out, Link an order I placed as a guest, Refresh token.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `GST-041`, `WEB-016`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 8 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Availability is live, never cached |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Availability unavailable. **Selection is blocked** — overselling is worse than waiting |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Sold out is a real answer.** Offers the next available rather than a dead end |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** Sending, claiming and listing for resale need the connection — a transfer nobody received is a ticket nobody holds. Tickets already loaded stay visible. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 Ticket already redeemed (`alreadyRedeemed`), already offered (`alreadyOffered`), or the product forbids transfer (`transferNotAllowed`). (TicketTransferProblem) |

#### Permissions

#### Requirements it meets

5 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19.2.13 | Ticket Transfer - System shall support ticket transfers. | Guest Mobile App & Branding | CONTRACTED | `transferOrderTickets` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Duplicate screens become one implementation covering several screen IDs (mobile Transfer + Delivery & Sharing; web Wishlist / Devices & Consent; Help Centre + Help & Accessibility as one Help view with FAQ, cases, policies, accessibility tabs). Ticket-selection functions belong on GST-008. Web gets a Group Booking view. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-D3 · D. Duplicate screens merged; group booking on web · DI-1078)*
- Supporting configuration: ticket variants (adult/child/senior/VIP, configurable), waitlist, on-sale/off-sale timing and cut-offs, entitlement/access rules (single/multi-venue, entries, zones, early entry), fulfilment channels (email, WhatsApp, SMS), after-sales windows (upgrade, reschedule, cancel), dynamic/fixed pricing and promotions. *(client request · MoM 24 Aug 2026, 4.5 Ticketing Configuration Walkthrough · DI-437)*
- Ticket delivery: "Add to Wallet" (Apple or Google Wallet by device), and WhatsApp, SMS or email per the guest's chosen method, selectable at checkout/confirmation; tickets can also be emailed to a third party. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-198)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### References

- Wireframe frame: `wireframes/P02 Guest App.dc.html#gst-045` · status **notStarted** · provenance client-verified
- Prototype (rev 3, verified 2026-09-28, match partial): `sources/designs/guest-rev3-28-september/TICVAI Guest Booking Mobile v2.dc.html`, view *Account → All screens → Wave 2 → Ticket delivery & sharing (opens Ticket transfer)*. Differences: No screen of its own; it shares GST-014’s screen until the client confirms.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (8), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (409).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (0 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-045?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Transfer order tickets.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 3 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `GST-055` Dynamic QR Ticket

**Find dynamic qr ticket for this venue.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Account & Self-Service · wave 1 · needs the `ticketing` module |

| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | configEditor (comfortable density): the screen declares only writes (`transferOrderTickets`) and no read of a population — it is settings, not a list |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** A ticket already loaded shows its rotating code, derived on the device from its seed, so it changes with no signal (decided 28 September, audit R230). Transferring a ticket needs the connection. |
| Opens with | `orderId` (deepLink), `entitlementId` (navigation), `credentialId` (navigation) · cold entry: **A guest opening an order link weeks later.** Shows the order if it still resolves; if it was refunded or the performance passed, says which and offers the … |
| Route | `/general/dynamic-qr-ticket` |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement.

**Known gaps.** **`getEntitlementCredential` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Tickets tab: purchased tickets with a scan code (dynamic QR refreshing every 30 s), add to wallet or calendar, send/share, refund or resale. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tickets and scan · DI-1083)*
- Tickets tab shows the guest's purchased tickets and their scan code. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1022)*
- Once activated in the app a digital ticket is bound to one approved device; moving to a new device requires deactivating the prior binding. Credential transfer moves a ticket to another person's device and invalidates the original holder's copy. *(client request · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.8 Device Binding, Credential Transfer & Revocation · DI-636)*
- Any online purchase for a dynamic-QR event must be linked to the mobile app to show the working code; web/desktop purchases are redirected into the app for activation, not exempted. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.7 Confirmed (Pradnya's question) · DI-635)*
- The dynamic QR stays blurred until beacon proximity is detected, then activates and refreshes on a short interval (e.g. every 6-12 seconds); screenshot capture of the active code is prevented. *(client request · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.6 Credential activation and display rules · DI-632)*
- Qossai: the dynamic QR must appear and work without internet, since crowded events (10,000+) suffer severe congestion; it must work offline via Bluetooth/beacon or an equivalent local mechanism. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.6 Hard requirement (offline) · DI-631)*
- **Open question.** Dynamic QR refreshes periodically to cut fraud/resale. Open: beacon-based (code hidden until the phone is near a gate beacon via Bluetooth, then refreshes ~every 2 minutes; Qossai: more secure) vs app-generated; GPS geofencing also raised. Chinmay to propose. *(open · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.6 Dynamic QR Code - Concept & Generation Approach · DI-630)*
- Ticket + combo meal: one QR holds both admission and meal; scanned at entry and again at the F&B counter to redeem the meal; a second meal redemption is refused. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 6. Food & Beverage — Ordering, Delivery, and Redemption · DI-287)*
- Dynamic QR: the ticket QR is non-scannable until the guest is on site, then activates and refreshes continuously to prevent misuse (reconfirmed). *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.9 "Plan Your Adventure" (Itinerary Planner) · DI-219)*
- The ticket QR code regenerates every 15-30 seconds (configurable). *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 7. Ticket Validation & Offline Architecture · DI-064)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**What the spec says about it.** **A guest can legally demand their data and its erasure, and had nowhere to ask.** `exportSubjectData` and `deleteGuestAccount` existed as guest-callable operations reachable from no guest surface — a promise the contracts made and the product did not keep. **Erasure is not a button.** `platform.dsar_request` carries a legal clock and a lifecycle; this screen starts it and shows where it has got to. **A request that silently fails is a regulatory failure with a timestamp on it** (ADR-0033).

**Form: Save guest preferences** (modal, opened by *Save guest preferences*; *Save guest preferences* calls `updateGuestPreferences`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `updateGuestPreferences` sends before it is called.** Nothing in the body is required. Optional: `id`, `subjectId`, `seatingPreference`, `drinkPreferences`, `dietary`, `accessibility`, `preferredChannel`. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

**Form: Upload guest document** (modal, opened by *Upload guest document*; *Upload guest document* calls `uploadGuestDocument`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `uploadGuestDocument` sends before it is called.** Required: `id`, `subjectId`, `kind`, `storageRef`, `retainUntil`. Optional: `contentType`, `consentPurposeId`, `uploadedAt`, `uploadedByPrincipalId`. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**The consent state** (detail panel, from `getGuestConsents`)

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Purposes | list or chips (count when long) | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Delete guest account (destructive button) | `deleteGuestAccount` DELETE `/auth/guest/account` | — | inline | 409 Open orders or an unexpired entitlement exist. Deleting an account with a valid ticket in it strands the guest at a gate. | — |
| Save guest preferences (secondary button) | `updateGuestPreferences` PUT `/guests/{subjectId}/preferences` | GuestPreferences | GuestPreferences | — | opens modal first |
| Upload guest document (secondary button) | `uploadGuestDocument` POST `/guest-documents` | GuestDocument | GuestDocument | — | opens modal first |
| Export subject data (secondary button) | `exportSubjectData` POST `/guests/{subjectId}/data-export` | inline | inline | — | — |

**Data it reads**: `getGuestConsents` (onLoad, Read a guest's consent state); `getCookieConsentRuntime` (onLoad, Tracking preferences: categories and the current decision); `listPublishedTrackingTechnologies` (onLoad, Each SDK and tracker the app uses); `getDeviceConsentHistory` (onLoad, My tracking decisions so far)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-039` Profile: *Profile*; carries `subjectId`

**What opens over it**

- confirmDialog *Delete guest account*: **Names what `deleteGuestAccount` changes and what it leaves alone**, in the consequence rather than the verb. A privacy data this affects should be identified in the dialog, not just counted.

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Content loads. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. **Says what failed and offers one way onward**, never a bare failure. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Nothing requested yet.** No export, no erasure, no document — and that is the ordinary state. **The screen explains what each request means before offering it**, because an erasure a guest did not understand is one they will phone about. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | **Nothing here yet.** The scope is what narrowed it — naming the scope is what stops somebody concluding the record does not exist. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `GUEST_VIEW_PII`, which `exportSubjectData` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **Nothing here is offered offline, and the banner says so.** An erasure request or a device change queued and never sent is worse than one that could not be made — the legal clock starts when the platform receives it, and a device signed out offline is still signed in. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 No published banner design with this id for the channel, or a category the design does not offer; 409 Open orders or an unexpired entitlement exist. Deleting an account with a valid ticket in it strands the guest at a gate.; 409 `noticeVersion` is no longer the published one (`notice-superseded`); read `getCookieConsentRuntime` again and show the current banner; 422 `strictlyNecessary` … |

#### Permissions

- `exportSubjectData` → `GUEST_VIEW_PII` (operate) · staff, guest
- `deleteGuestAccount` → no permission · guest
- `getGuestConsents` → `GUEST_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `updateGuestPreferences` → `GUEST_MANAGE` (configure) · staff, guest
- `uploadGuestDocument` → `GUEST_VIEW_PII` (operate) · staff, guest
- `getCookieConsentRuntime` → no permission · anonymous, guest
- `listPublishedTrackingTechnologies` → no permission · anonymous, guest
- `getDeviceConsentHistory` → no permission · anonymous, guest
- `recordDeviceConsent` → no permission · anonymous, guest

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `GUEST_VIEW_PII`, which `exportSubjectData` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

16 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Qossai: use an existing major venue-group client's live app and published privacy policy as the model for how facial-recognition consent, data use and retention are explained to guests. *(client request · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.11 Privacy & Biometric Data Retention · DI-642)*
- Data-subject requests (access, correction, deletion) are tracked with status submitted → in progress → completed. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.3 Consent, Data Privacy & Retention · DI-379)*

Also apply: 1 for P02 · Account & Self-Service, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Footer*, set in `CMS-007` Page Builder:

Also set there, as content the tenant writes: social links: platform.

*Cookie banner*, set in `CMS-026` Cookie Banner & Preference Center Designer:

| Regulatory regimes (`cookieBanner.regulatoryRegimes`) | Gdpr · E privacy · Ccpa cpra · Lgpd · Uae pdpl · Saudi pdpl | — | 2.6.60 (29 September, build). The laws this design is published to satisfy, so compliance is stated rather than assumed. |
| Record ip address (`cookieBanner.recordIpAddress`) | — | off | 2.6.55, "if legally permitted" (29 September, build). On, `recordDeviceConsent` writes the IP address and user agent to `pii.consent_identifier`; off, they are not kept anywhere. |

- [ ] Every output is drawn (2 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-066?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Delete guest account, Save guest preferences, Upload guest document, Export subject data.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-039`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 2 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Never configurable:** The *Powered by TICVAI* credit in the footer is fixed and never client-editable (MoM 3 Aug, DI-111; MoM 12 Aug, DI-250). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P02 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Mobile App v4.dc.html`: Mobile App v4, the newest guest look (29 September, with the 30 September feedback in the booking flows). It replaces the 28 September Mobile v2 build.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the booking engine that runs inside the app. Keep both files in the same folder.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P02 Guest App

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Products can be presented in multiple card layout styles: carousel, video poster, split, etc. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1089)*
- The home-screen navigation bar layout is configurable: home/explore/map/buy-tickets in different arrangements. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1087)*
- The revised mobile app design is approved in direction: Qossai liked the opening video and visual polish, Allam the UI/graphics quality. Its flow is deliberately different from the web application (after front-end team input), not a reused structure. Detailed feedback to follow. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.4 Guest Mobile App — Revised Design Walkthrough · DI-1086)*
- Every web product and flow stays bookable in the mobile app (incl. cabanas, surf, 2D/3D stadium, theatre plan, bus route map), each with its own step order; a toggle switches back to one decision per screen. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — All web products and flows available · DI-1084)*
- Mobile app must not open straight into booking (client found it unclear). Tabs: Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references), with a persistent "Buy tickets" button on every screen (raised centre button, or floating / flat per venue). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tabs Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets, persistent Buy tickets · DI-1081)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Optional intro video on opening the app, with a "Skip introduction" control. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1020)*
- A persistent "Buy tickets" button appears on every screen of the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1017)*
- Mobile tabs: Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1016)*
- The current mobile build goes straight into the booking journey and the client finds it unclear: redesign the UI. All web products and flows, including cabanas and surf, must remain available. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1015)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Accreditation is primarily completed in the web portal (document upload and photo checks suit a larger screen); the same submission is also available in the guest mobile app as a secondary option for individuals. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.8 Accreditation Channel Placement & API Access · DI-666)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

### In P02 · Account & Self-Service

- Decision: profiles are never merged automatically. Likely duplicates are notified to the customer (push or e-mail) and merge only on the customer's confirmation; an admin review queue tracks flagged duplicates independently of the customer's response. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.2 Duplicate Detection; 5. Key Decisions · DI-377)*

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.
