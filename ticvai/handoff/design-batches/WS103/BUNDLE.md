## Who this is for

**platformAdmin on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 5 permissions apply here:
  `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS, REGION_CONFIGURE, SCOPE_MANAGE, TENANT_CONFIGURE, USER_MANAGE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

| `ADM-427` | Provisioning Validation & Exception Management | B–D | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 0 | — | notStarted (—) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**ADM-419, ADM-420, ADM-423, ADM-424, ADM-425, ADM-427 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- After contract, TICVAI provisions the tenant with a basic setup reflecting the tier and licensed modules (e.g. mobile app, B2C, B2B enabled as contracted) before handover; AI can assist initial product/event/ticket setup following the same process as manual setup. *(client request · MoM 10 Sep 2026, 4.12 Tenant Provisioning & Go-Live Setup · DI-833)*

Also apply: 9 for all of P09, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

### `ADM-421` Venue & Operational Structure Creation

**Automatically create the initial venue structure using information collected during onboarding.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Control · P09 TICVAI Web (web) |
| Module | Tenants & Licensing · wave 3 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |

| Route | `/tenants-licensing/venue-operational-structure-creation-adm-421` |

**Known gaps.** **Venue & Operational Structure Creation declares no operation that writes anything** — its only declared call is `none`, a read. The name promises authoring and the contract offers none, so either …

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (decided 28 September, audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7), `permissions` (tenant permissions only — the ones this screen's operations need, preselected), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ID `id` | picker: choose an id | required | — | — | shows names, sends the id | Client-generated UUIDv7 for the grant. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |

| Ticket ref `ticketRef` | text field | optional | — | max length 100 | — | The support case this access serves, where there is one. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Expires at `expiresAt` | date and time picker | required | — | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (detail panel, from `openPlatformStaffGrant`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (decided 28 September, audit R098): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ID | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Operator display name | text | — |
| Permissions | list or chips (count when long) | — |

| Ticket ref | text | — |
| Opened at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Expires at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Data it reads**: `listTenants` (onLoad, The tenant picker — the operator picks a tenant before …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `ADM-419` Provisioning Command Center: *Back to Provisioning Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The venue operational structure configuration as saved. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the venue operational structure untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No venue operational structure configured yet. Carries the create action and says what the platform does in the meantime. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | **Nothing matched.** The filter or the scope narrowed it — naming which is what stops somebody concluding the record does not exist |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (decided 28 September, audit R098). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 Username already in use within this cell |

#### Permissions

- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa
- `createPrincipal` → `USER_MANAGE` (configure) · staff, partner
- `setPasswordPolicy` → `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

2 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1.6 | The system should be able to create a new Back Office/POS user and Logon to back office/POS using new user. | F&B POS | CONTRACTED | `createPrincipal` |
| 2.6.6 | It is expected to have one webstore/application API for each venue. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | data `Tenant` |

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 9 for all of P09, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-041, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*

- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform.

Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P09 TICVAI Web

- Portal access exposes TICVAI pricing, so prospects submit contact details and a trade license as proof of a real venue, reviewed and approved by TICVAI before access is granted. *(agreed · MoM 10 Sep 2026, 4.8 Customer Portal Access, Authentication & Verification · DI-827)*
- Simulation functionality stays embedded within each relevant configuration section rather than being consolidated, since it tests that section's own configuration. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-722)*
- **Open question.** Proposed tenant hierarchy Tenant > Organization/Brand > Region > Branch > Venue > Department, under review against TICVAI's own organisational hierarchy before finalising. *(open · MoM 30 Jul 2026, 2. Proposed Multi-Tenant Hierarchy · DI-055)*

- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*

**5 more name particular screens** and are in each screen's block above (*Client meeting inputs*).

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```json
{
"createOrgUnit": {"method":"POST","path":"/org-units","contract":"tenancy","summary":"Create a scope node","permission":"SCOPE_MANAGE","offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"brand","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":"CreateScopeNodeRequest","responds":"OrgUnit"},

}
```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
