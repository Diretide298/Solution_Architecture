## Who this is for

**guest on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 3 permissions apply here:
  `ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store. Offline, a screen shows what was already loaded, under the banner below.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale)

A guest finds something to do, picks when and how many, holds capacity, pays, and receives a ticket they can show at the gate, transfer or resell. The same booking engine serves the guest website (P01, WEB-), the guest app (P02, GST-) and, through the same catalogue, cart and order operations, the kiosk (P05), the cashier at the till (P04) and the staff handheld (P06); partners book on credit through the partner portal (P10). Guest surfaces are white-label (venue logo, colours, fonts, card layouts, step indicator style, cart placement) with "Powered by TICVAI" kept; the till and handheld stay TICVAI-branded. The booking runs in a fixed order that the client set on 29 September and confirmed on 30 September: for a dated product, the date first, then the time (hidden until a date), then the tickets (hidden until a time); undated products go straight to the tickets; product-first flows (workshops) pick the product, then the date; seated events with one performance open on the seat map, sections first, zoom into a section, pinch out to compare. Choosing a date, time or session commits nothing; capacity is held only when a quantity is set (a 15-minute basket window, 8 minutes for seats and cabanas, one extension). The guest counters (adult, child, senior, infant, person of determination) belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices, so a basket line is "<ticket> · <guest type> × <n>"; group and school products start from group ticket cards and a typed headcount (minus, plus, and +10 on the app), supervisors free. Help me choose filters the catalogue on the server (never a consent step) with Show everything; consent questions such as "Are you able to swim?" are asked once after the session is picked and never again where the page already asked. Sign-in or the six-digit guest code is asked when the guest leaves Add-ons (or at payment, per venue), only the fields the venue configured; after the code, only the T&Cs tick remains (W1). Payment creates the order first and treats an unknown outcome as "checking with your bank", never a second charge; tickets issue on payment, go to Apple or Google Wallet, and a dynamic-QR event's ticket lives in the app. The guest app is deliberately not a copy of the website (30 September): its structure is Home, Explore, Plan and Tickets tabs with a persistent Buy tickets button, item pages that propose the right product (a restaurant's meal combo that includes admission), ride videos that play with no loader, a visit planner that plans each day at one park from that park's rides, dining and shops only, and in-park walking navigation; the booking flow inside it is functionally identical to the web. Vocabulary in guest copy follows the glossary's recorded exceptions (Booking, Session, QR). source: [F01, F02, F03, F07, F49, F52, F55, F57, F58, F59, MoM 29 Sep 1 (W1-W12), MoM 29 Sep 2, MoM 29 Sep 3, MoM 30 Sep 4.4-4.8, CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP 1-6, CLIENT-RESPONSE-REV3-25SEP, REV3-1, REV3-2, REV3-3, REV3-4, REV3-26, DI-1086 …

### Food, Beverage & Retail

Food & beverage, retail, rentals, inventory and procurement across the till (P04), the kitchen display (P15), the staff app (P06), Venue Management (P08), the guest web and app (P01/P02), the kiosk (P05) and the CMS (P13). COUNTER SERVICE (F108): the cashier takes the order on the Food & Drink board from the outlet's menu in force (sections in the outlet's order, option groups attached to the item), sends it to the kitchen, and only then charges — send to kitchen, then charge, for every POS F&B order (R261, upheld against the v2 frame by POSV2-4). The kitchen ticket is on the rail while the card is in the guest's hand; an unpaid sent order is cancelled while ordered or accepted and voided with a reason after (R125(3), R091(5)); the guest gets an order number, and the customer-facing status board (numbers only) is the kitchen display's KIT-007, mirrored on the till's queue (POSV2-7). TABLE SERVICE (F29, F80, F94): a party is seated with its covers, orders across the visit, courses are fired by the pass (DI-333, DI-407), the bill is printed and settled at the end and split by amount, covers, category, item or seat (DI-106); the client's table statuses are Available → Ordered → Table closed → Reserved with no cleaning status (DI-336); moving and merging tables stay on the staff app until after r2 (POSV2-8). GUEST ORDERING (F11, F48): a guest inside the venue orders in the app or web for pickup or delivery to a seat or a scanned location (DI-288, DI-291); F&B and retail are optional licensed modules completed inside TICVAI (DI-505), kept simple (DI-1091); no food without an admission ticket (DI-292); table reservations and the waitlist do not go through the cart and a dining deposit is a venue option, off by default (DI-1048, DI-1049, R077). KITCHEN (P15, F83, F88): TICVAI's own display on commodity screens (19 September, replacing the 31 July "integration point only", DI-077); one kitchen ticket per preparation station from the outlet's routing rules with a fallback display (DI-323); a fired timer counts up and resets per course, not shown for quick service (DI-334); displays are assigned to stations and filter by course, with no station-load tile in r1 (R277). 86 takes an item off sale on every till and guest menu immediately (R110(c)); guests always see "Sold out", never a missing dish. RETAIL (F17, F34, F51): scan and sell through the same cart, charge and payment as tickets and food (DI-795), one cart, one receipt and one QR per guest (DI-293); system stock per venue gates the sale (DI-294); returns by receipt or order number only in r1 (R139(c)), refund to the original tender with a reason code and note (DI-796, DI-797); Shop & Drop is paid online and collected on the way out (R236), a merchandise reservation lasts to the end of the visit day (R169, R215). TILL MONEY (F32, F73, F74, F87): the float is counted by denomination with note images and typed quantities (DI-775, DI-776, R229) while the hardware checks itself (DI-778); the close is a …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WEB-033` | Shop | A | 45 | 5 | 6 | 24 | 3 | 0 | guest | review (client-verified) |
| `WEB-042` | Retail & Shop and Drop | A | 23 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 4 | 0 | guest | review (client-verified) |

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*

- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*

- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred.

- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P01 Guest Web

- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Confirmed final: cart sliding in from the right or bottom, card size options, and cart-sidebar placement left or right; Qossai specifically liked the compact card size. No further changes requested. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.10 Guest Web App — Card Layout & Cart Configuration Confirmed · DI-991)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- The reviewed prototype is the actual guest-facing B2C site customers browse and book from, not a CMS tool. A separate, more limited white-label interface lets a client adjust colours, fonts and layout from a menu of options; not yet built in the prototype. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-887)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Qossai is dissatisfied with the current B2C guest platform build and wants a separate vision session; references: the "Little Explorer" site and Six Flags. Six Flags cues: single-page flow. *(client request · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.20 Planning & Next Steps · DI-736)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Configurable cookie consent banner (accept/reject) per website; some cookies flagged mandatory (non-rejectable), others optional; templated and configurable in the system. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.13 Privacy Consent & Cookie Policy · DI-617)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Six Flags Kidiya reference: fixed header with configurable navigation (logo, Explore/Tickets/Passes, sub-menus), every item toggleable via the CMS. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review — Six Flags Kidiya Reference Walkthrough · DI-424)*
- Allam: the venue's main website is fully venue-managed; after "Book Now" the white-label B2C flow keeps the venue's header/footer branding while product selection, cart and checkout are TICVAI-managed. Header/footer links to non-checkout pages redirect to the main venue site. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-397)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- A multi-language toggle switches the entire site's content. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-120)*
- Allam: banner, header, footer and background color are CMS-configurable per client, but site structure and navigation flow are fixed and adapt automatically to product configuration (dated, non-dated, seated, membership products surface the right fields). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-119)*
- All sites are fully mobile-responsive; e.g. the desktop calendar view collapses into a mobile-optimized layout. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-113)*
- A "powered by [platform]" footer credit is fixed and not client-editable. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-111)*
- One client can run multiple branded sites from the same setup, e.g. two brands sharing a footer but with distinct headers and hero banners. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-110)*
- White-label sites share one platform/template but each is configured independently: header, footer, logo, colors, fonts and hero banner are client-editable from the backend. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-108)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

### Screen by screen

**`WEB-033` Shop**

- **Open question.** Resources: meeting-room booking (headcount, duration, time slot, room, add-ons tea/coffee/snacks), modelled on House of Wisdom. Merchandise: browse, cart with add/remove quantity, pickup or doorstep delivery. F&B: outlet/menu browsing; collect at counter, curbside, doorstep or priority delivery. *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Resources, Merchandise, F&B) · DI-690)*
- Decision (raised by Aishwarya): F&B and retail/merchandise online sale are optional back-office-enabled modules; where enabled, the whole purchase (browse, cart, checkout, pickup-at-venue or ship-to-guest) completes inside TICVAI — guests are never sent to download a separate app. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-505)*
- Retail items (e.g. a t-shirt plus a cap) can be combined into a combo package with bundle-level pricing, presented both on-site and online with product images and descriptions. *(client request · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.3 Pricing, Bundles & Promotions · DI-358)*

**`WEB-042` Retail & Shop and Drop**

- Decision (raised by Aishwarya): F&B and retail/merchandise online sale are optional back-office-enabled modules; where enabled, the whole purchase (browse, cart, checkout, pickup-at-venue or ship-to-guest) completes inside TICVAI — guests are never sent to download a separate app. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-505)*
- Once a delivery address is entered, the applicable shipping fee is shown automatically for the customer to accept before payment. *(client request · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.8 Online Order Fulfilment & Shipping Configuration · DI-360)*
- Online retail offers buy-online-pickup-in-store and buy-online-ship-to-address. Shipping fees are set by region/city (e.g. Dubai, Abu Dhabi, international); decision: operations enter courier rates and margins manually, no live courier-API integration at this stage. *(agreed · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.3 Pricing, Bundles & Promotions; 4.8 Online Order Fulfilment & Shipping Configuration · DI-359)*
- F&B: browse outlets and order; pickup location shown automatically per outlet, with delivery as an extra option (needs guest location) when the venue uses the platform's F&B module. Retail follows the same pickup/delivery model. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.4 Venue Map, Queueing, F&B, Retail & Parking · DI-205)*
