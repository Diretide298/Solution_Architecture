## Who this is for

**guest on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 1 permissions apply here:
  `ORDER_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **1 of these operations work offline**: listMyEntitlements
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Food, Beverage & Retail

Food & beverage, retail, rentals, inventory and procurement across the till (P04), the kitchen display (P15), the staff app (P06), Venue Management (P08), the guest web and app (P01/P02), the kiosk (P05) and the CMS (P13). COUNTER SERVICE (F108): the cashier takes the order on the Food & Drink board from the outlet's menu in force (sections in the outlet's order, option groups attached to the item), sends it to the kitchen, and only then charges — send to kitchen, then charge, for every POS F&B order (R261, upheld against the v2 frame by POSV2-4). The kitchen ticket is on the rail while the card is in the guest's hand; an unpaid sent order is cancelled while ordered or accepted and voided with a reason after (R125(3), R091(5)); the guest gets an order number, and the customer-facing status board (numbers only) is the kitchen display's KIT-007, mirrored on the till's queue (POSV2-7). TABLE SERVICE (F29, F80, F94): a party is seated with its covers, orders across the visit, courses are fired by the pass (DI-333, DI-407), the bill is printed and settled at the end and split by amount, covers, category, item or seat (DI-106); the client's table statuses are Available → Ordered → Table closed → Reserved with no cleaning status (DI-336); moving and merging tables stay on the staff app until after r2 (POSV2-8). GUEST ORDERING (F11, F48): a guest inside the venue orders in the app or web for pickup or delivery to a seat or a scanned location (DI-288, DI-291); F&B and retail are optional licensed modules completed inside TICVAI (DI-505), kept simple (DI-1091); no food without an admission ticket (DI-292); table reservations and the waitlist do not go through the cart and a dining deposit is a venue option, off by default (DI-1048, DI-1049, R077). KITCHEN (P15, F83, F88): TICVAI's own display on commodity screens (19 September, replacing the 31 July "integration point only", DI-077); one kitchen ticket per preparation station from the outlet's routing rules with a fallback display (DI-323); a fired timer counts up and resets per course, not shown for quick service (DI-334); displays are assigned to stations and filter by course, with no station-load tile in r1 (R277). 86 takes an item off sale on every till and guest menu immediately (R110(c)); guests always see "Sold out", never a missing dish. RETAIL (F17, F34, F51): scan and sell through the same cart, charge and payment as tickets and food (DI-795), one cart, one receipt and one QR per guest (DI-293); system stock per venue gates the sale (DI-294); returns by receipt or order number only in r1 (R139(c)), refund to the original tender with a reason code and note (DI-796, DI-797); Shop & Drop is paid online and collected on the way out (R236), a merchandise reservation lasts to the end of the visit day (R169, R215). TILL MONEY (F32, F73, F74, F87): the float is counted by denomination with note images and typed quantities (DI-775, DI-776, R229) while the hardware checks itself (DI-778); the close is a …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GST-061` | Menu Item Detail | A | 1 | 4 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 2 | guest | notStarted (client-verified) |
| `GST-062` | Shop & Drop Collection | A | 0 | 22 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 0 | guest | notStarted (client-verified) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**GST-061, GST-062 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `GST-061` Menu Item Detail

**Decide on a dish, choose modifiers, check allergens.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | In-Venue Experience · wave 1 · needs the `fnb` module |
| Block | Block A · task APP-MOB-GST-061 |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): One dish from the outlet's guest menu, with its modifiers and allergens (CHG-SGU-018) |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** The dish already loaded stays, with a note that it may be out of date and its allergens in full. Ordering is refused — availability changes by the minute. |
| Opens with | `outletId` (deepLink), `menuItemId` (deepLink) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared ticket, a forwarded confirmation … |
| Route | `/in-venue-experience/menu-item-detail` |

**What the spec says about it.** P02-019.1 in the client hierarchy. Absent from my page inventory until 14 August. **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added listModifierGroups. **The same screen on web and app was calling different operations** — one side could do something the other could not, and nothing recorded the difference as deliberate. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Modifier side panel drawn (REV3-9, no api change); the *F&B add-ons & modifiers* toggle is dropped.

**From the Food, Beverage & Retail process.** The app's dish page and modifier panel: decide on a dish, choose options, check allergens. It must be functionally identical to WEB-037. The one thing to get right: allergens are complete and update as options are chosen; required choices are clear before Add.

**Contract gap logged** (the fix needs an operation or field the contracts do not have yet; draw the corrected version and mark what waits on the contract, as the open change entry says)

- The guest menu's allergens lack "may contain" and the dietary flags. (CHG-SGU-024)

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Only outletId is taken on entry, with no dish identifier. A table "Every modifier group" lists every group with scopePath. The empty state … (CHG-SGU-018); The navigation leads from the dish page to GST-062 (Shop & Drop Collection). (CHG-SGU-018).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Modifiers | select field | — | — | — | — | Constraints come from the group — minimum, maximum, required | — |

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| At | date and time picker | — | — | `getGuestMenu` ?at |
| Language | language picker | — | — | `getGuestMenu` ?language |

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Choose-one groups, add-ons, leave-outs, quantity, kitchen note**: Same rules as WEB-037. Required groups are marked and block Add until chosen. Maximums cap the checkboxes. Defaults are preselected. Unavailable options show "Sold out" and are never hidden. Quantity 1 to 20. Kitchen note up to 200 characters. *(source: contracts/satellite/fnb.yaml#/components/schemas/ModifierGroup / contracts/satellite/fnb.yaml#/components/schemas/CreateGuestOrderLine / DI-1050)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Banner** (banner): Allergens. Always present; not a field a tenant may omit (4.8.9)

**The dish** (detail panel, from `getGuestMenu`): The dish `menuItemId` resolved inside the outlet's `getGuestMenu`: photo, name, description, price, its modifier groups (min and max per group) and allergens. Until the guest menu carries the Allergen object, "Contains" is drawn from the current list and "May contain" and the diet badges (vegetarian, vegan, halal) are drawn as pending (CHG-SGU-024).

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | — |
| In force until | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | When this menu stops applying. The client shows it, because a guest browsing breakfast at 10:55 should know. |
| Currency | text | — |
| Sections | list or chips (count when long) | — |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Allergens, live total, basket line**: Same as WEB-037. Allergens appear in a banner that is always present, including those added by the chosen options. The total updates live, and the basket line lists the choices. *(source: contracts/satellite/fnb.yaml#/components/schemas/AllergenCode / DI-1050)*
- **Panel form**: A bottom sheet on the phone, with Add to order fixed at the foot showing the live total ("Add 2 · AED 88.00"). *(source: DI-1050 / designer default)*

**What each action does** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Add to order**: Adds the line to the GST-024 basket and closes the sheet. *(source: screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-061)*

**Data it reads**: `getGuestMenu` (onLoad, Item, modifiers and allergens)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `GST-024` F&B – Browse & Order: *Back to the menu*; carries `outletId`
- → `GST-041` Checkout Entry: *Add and view the basket*

**What opens over it**

- drawer *Add, on an item with modifier groups attached*: **A panel of choices**: choose-one groups (e.g. spice level), priced optional add-ons within their limits, leave-outs and quantity; the basket line lists the choices. Shown whenever the item has groups attached (`listModifierGroups`); no tenant on/off toggle (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-9).

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Item skeleton |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Item unavailable, with a route back to the menu |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | Not applicable |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Never shown: a menu is public and browsing a dish needs no sign-in. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** The dish already loaded stays, with a note that it may be out of date and its allergens in full. Ordering is refused — availability changes by the minute. |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Required group all sold out; constraint refused at order time; offline**: As WEB-037. *(source: contracts/satellite/fnb.yaml#/components/schemas/GuestOrderProblem / screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-061)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-037`: Functionally identical (DI-970, REV3-9).
- Match `GST-024`: Opened by Add on a dish with groups; returns to the same basket.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
seeAlso: WEB-037 sampleData
```

#### Permissions

- `getGuestMenu` → no permission · guest, staff

**A refused user sees:** Never shown: a menu is public and browsing a dish needs no sign-in.

#### Requirements it meets

1 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13.3.9 | APIs shall support menu retrieval, order creation, order status, kitchen status, inventory updates and promotions. | Developer & API Management | CONTRACTED | `getGuestMenu` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- In takeaway, delivery and café menus, Add opens a side panel for the dish: choose-one options (spice level, drink size, ice), optional priced add-ons (sides, dips, toppings, leave-outs) and quantity; total updates live and the basket line lists the choices. Shown whenever the item has modifier groups (no toggle). *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-9 · 9. Add-ons and modifiers for F&B menu items · DI-1050)*
- Modifiers can be free or chargeable with minimum/maximum selection rules; combo meals support component selection with upgrade options at additional cost. *(client request · MoM 18 Aug 2026, 4.4 Menu, Product & Recipe Management · DI-328)*

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

- **A82** Design the F&B Command Center suite: a real-time cross-outlet sales/operations dashboard, the F&B Stock Command Center (stock value, low-stock alerts, recipe-based consumption, batch/wastage tracking, replenishment … *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S10 (decision log, for TICVAI's review) · 18 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'recipe')*
- **A83** Design the Menu & Product Command Center and Menu Builder (recipe/product mapping alerts, drag-and-drop POS layout, chargeable/free modifiers with min/max rules, combo meals with upgrade options) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S10 (decision log, for TICVAI's review) · 18 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'menu & product')*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### References

- Wireframe frame: `wireframes/P02 Guest App.dc.html#gst-061` · status **notStarted** · provenance client-verified
- Prototype (rev 3, verified 2026-09-28, match exact): `sources/designs/guest-rev3-28-september/TICVAI Guest Booking Mobile v2.dc.html`, view *Account → All screens → Wave 2 → Menu item detail; Rev 3 feedback → Menu item add-ons & modifiers*. Differences: Rev 3 adds min/max selection rules for each modifier group, priced add-ons, leave-outs and a live total.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (1), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (404).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (4 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-061?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] The screen has no action of its own; nothing is drawn as a button that does nothing.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `GST-024`, `GST-041`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 2 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] The 1 edge case(s) from the process notes are drawn.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `GST-062` Shop & Drop Collection

**Collect shopping left earlier, using the ticket rather than a receipt.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | In-Venue Experience · wave 1 · needs the `retail` module |
| Block | Block A · task APP-MOB-GST-062 |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | statusTracker (comfortable density): A status list of every shop-and-drop waiting for the guest, read by `lookupShopAndDrop` (a GET with query identifiers, so no request body) (CHG-SGU-018) |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows, and lookup cannot run.** A drop reference already on screen stays visible so the guest can quote it at the collection point. Reserving merchandise needs the connection. |
| Opens with | `subjectId` (session) |
| Route | `/in-venue-experience/shop-and-drop-collection` |

**What the spec says about it.** 4.4.7. Claimed by the entitlement the guest is already carrying, not a paper slip. **The guest's drops are found by their own tickets (listMyEntitlements, then lookupShopAndDrop per entitlementId), bound 4 October 2026** (CHG-FXS-003)

**From the Food, Beverage & Retail process.** "What am I collecting, where and by when." Every shop-and-drop waiting for the guest on one screen, claimed by the ticket they are already carrying rather than a paper slip. The one thing to get right: nothing to type for a signed-in guest, and a code big enough to show at the desk.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The pattern is a settings editor ("configEditor", form template). The states read "The saved shop drop collection", "No shop drop … (CHG-SGU-018); The empty state for no access names ORDER_VIEW. (CHG-GST-004); The navigation leads to GST-061 (Menu Item Detail). (CHG-SGU-018); GST-062 is wave 3 while WEB-042, which does the same lookup, is wave 2. (CHG-SGU-018).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Entitlement | text field | — | — | `lookupShopAndDrop` ?entitlementId |
| Drop reference | text field | — | — | `lookupShopAndDrop` ?dropReference |
| Receipt number | text field | — | — | `lookupShopAndDrop` ?receiptNumber |
| State | radio group | Usable now | Usable now · Upcoming · Expired · All | `listMyEntitlements` ?state |
| Include shared | toggle | on | — | `listMyEntitlements` ?includeShared |

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Find by**: Automatic for a signed-in guest: the app looks up by the guest's own tickets. A fallback field "Drop reference or receipt number" is for a guest whose ticket is not in the app. At least one identifier is always sent. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#lookupShopAndDrop / F17 step 3)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Waiting for you** (card list, from `lookupShopAndDrop`): One lookupShopAndDrop per ticket the guest carries (listMyEntitlements), merged; a receipt number or drop reference can be typed as well.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ID | text | — |
| Drop reference | text | Short and readable. Printed on the slip a guest may or may not keep. |
| Sale | text | The till sale. Null for an online order, which sets `orderId` (audit R236). |
| Order | the name it points at, never the id | The paid online order that created this collection (audit R236). |
| Entitlement | text | The ticket that claims these goods. The point of 4.4.7 — a guest does not have to keep a receipt safe for eight hours in a water park. |
| Subject | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Collection point | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Collection point name | text | — |
| Status | chip: Awaiting collection, Partially collected, Collected, Uncollected, Disposed | — |
| Lines | list or chips (count when long) | — |
| Line | text | — |
| Merchandise | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Name | text | — |
| Quantity | 1,234 | — |
| Collected quantity | 1,234 | — |
| Dropped at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Collect by | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Collected at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Collected by principal | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Verified by | text | — |

**Banner** (banner): Collect-by time. Usually venue close

**My tickets** (card list, from `listMyEntitlements`)

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Product | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Valid to | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | Resolved at issue from the template, then owned here. A freeze extends it, a reissue replaces it, and neither reaches back to the template. |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Collections list**: One card per drop: collection point name, "Collect by 22:00 today" in venue time, status (Waiting, Partly collected, Collected, Not collected), and the items with quantities (collected and still waiting where partial). Waiting first, newest first. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#/components/schemas/ShopAndDrop / F51 step 3)*
- **Show my code**: A full-screen, bright QR and the drop reference in large type, for the desk to scan. The guest's ticket QR works too, and the card says so. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#collectShopAndDrop / screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-062)*

**What each action does** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Show my code**: Opens the code full screen. Handing over is done by staff at the desk (BO-048), not in the app. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#collectShopAndDrop / F17 step 5)*
- **Directions to the collection point**: Opens the venue map at the collection point. *(source: F51 step 3 / designer default)*

**Data it reads**: `lookupShopAndDrop` (onLoad, Find a guest's dropped goods); `listMyEntitlements` (onLoad, The guest's tickets; lookupShopAndDrop is called once per …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `POS-012` Omnichannel Order & Fulfilment Center: *Collected on the way out, at the exit desk*; carries `dropId`, `orderId`; calls `lookupShopAndDrop`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Finding what is waiting for you. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the shop drop collection untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | Nothing waiting: no shop-and-drop for this guest. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `listMyEntitlements` requires to show this screen, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows, and lookup cannot run.** A drop reference already on screen stays visible so the guest can quote it at the collection point. Reserving merchandise needs the connection. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 No identifier supplied |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Nothing waiting**: "Nothing waiting for you to collect", with a link to the shop. *(source: designer default)*
- **Past the collect-by time**: The status is "Not collected", with the venue contact. Uncollected goods return to stock or go to lost property after the window. *(source: F51 step 3 / F17 step 5)*
- **Partly collected**: The items still waiting are listed; the same code collects the rest later. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#collectShopAndDrop)*
- **Offline**: A code already on screen stays visible; lookup waits for the connection. *(source: screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-062)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-042`: Functionally identical to WEB-042's "Find my collection" (DI-970), with the same card and code.
- Match `GST-026`: Bought there; the collection card after payment links here.
- Match `KSK-011`: If kiosks show shop-and-drop at all, it is the same card. A kiosk cannot hand goods over.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
seeAlso: WEB-042 sampleData
drops:
- reference: SD-4K7Q
  point: Collect at the gate
  collectBy: Sat 24 Oct 2026, 22:00
  status: Waiting
  items:
  - Aqua Park tee ×2
  - Kids' swim goggles
- reference: SD-4K9C
  point: East car park kiosk
  collectBy: Sat 24 Oct 2026, 22:00
  status: Partly collected
  items:
  - Beach umbrella ×2 (1 collected)
```

#### Permissions

- `lookupShopAndDrop` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `listMyEntitlements` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `listMyEntitlements` requires to show this screen, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

2 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.14.10 | Manage entitlement balances and usage limits. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | data `Entitlement` |
| 2.16.15 | The system shall support replacement of lost, damaged, or stolen media while automatically disabling previous media and preserving entitlement history. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | data `Entitlement` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Decision (raised by Aishwarya): F&B and retail/merchandise online sale are optional back-office-enabled modules; where enabled, the whole purchase (browse, cart, checkout, pickup-at-venue or ship-to-guest) completes inside TICVAI — guests are never sent to download a separate app. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-505)*
- Online retail offers buy-online-pickup-in-store and buy-online-ship-to-address. Shipping fees are set by region/city (e.g. Dubai, Abu Dhabi, international); decision: operations enter courier rates and margins manually, no live courier-API integration at this stage. *(agreed · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.3 Pricing, Bundles & Promotions; 4.8 Online Order Fulfilment & Shipping Configuration · DI-359)*

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### References

- Wireframe frame: `wireframes/P02 Guest App.dc.html#gst-062` · status **notStarted** · provenance client-verified
- Prototype (rev 3, verified 2026-09-28, match exact): `sources/designs/guest-rev3-28-september/TICVAI Guest Booking Mobile v2.dc.html`, view *Account → All screens → Wave 3 → Shop & drop collection*. Differences: Prototype uses a separate SD code; the YAML says the guest collects with the ticket.
- Flow F17 *A guest buys merchandise and collects later*, step 4: Guest tracks it in the app → Where it is, and until when
- Flow F51 *A guest shops in the venue and collects on the way out*, step 3: On the way out they find their collection point. → **One lookup, one code.** A guest at the exit with four bags to collect wants one screen, not four orders.
- Flow F51 branch at step 3 (medium): when The guest leaves without collecting., **Held to the venue policy and then returned to stock.** A collection point full of uncollected bags is a stockroom nobody counted.
- ADR-0025 *— One field says who may call an operation* (`docs/adr/0025-one-audience-field.md`)

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (0), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (22 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-062?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] The screen has no action of its own; nothing is drawn as a button that does nothing.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `POS-012`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 2 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] The 4 edge case(s) from the process notes are drawn.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Decided for every guest screen:** **No dark or light mode.** The venue's chosen theme applies on every device setting; `Theme.darkMode` is deprecated and ignored, never drawn, and the guest app has no Light/Dark switch (Chinmay, 2 October, Q150; CHG-CSA-035). ***Powered by TICVAI* is a tenant toggle, on by default** (`brand.showPoweredBy`): shown on the launch screen, at the foot of Account and in the web footer; switching it off needs the licence add-on, or 403 `powered-by-locked` (Chinmay, 2 October, Q160; DI-297; CHG-CSA-036). **Each homepage section sets its card count and its scroll animation** (`maxItems`; `scrollAnimation` rise, scale, slide, blur or none, default rise): every customisation option of the approved wireframe (Chinmay, 2 October, Q152 and Q153; DI-1088; CHG-CSA-040). **Landing-page templates.** A tenant with no landing page of its own starts from a TICVAI template (`listLandingPageTemplates`, kept as `HomepageLayout.templateKey`); one with its own site links in with deep links (`landingSource` ownSite) (Chinmay, 2 October, batch 2 #41; CHG-CSA-037).

**Never configurable:** A dark or light mode: the guest surfaces have one theme, the venue's (Chinmay, 2 October; CHG-CSA-035). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P02 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Mobile App v4.dc.html`: Mobile App v4, the newest guest look (29 September, with the 30 September feedback in the booking flows). It replaces the 28 September Mobile v2 build.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the booking engine that runs inside the app. Keep both files in the same folder.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P02 Guest App

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Products can be presented in multiple card layout styles: carousel, video poster, split, etc. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1089)*
- The home-screen navigation bar layout is configurable: home/explore/map/buy-tickets in different arrangements. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1087)*
- The revised mobile app design is approved in direction: Qossai liked the opening video and visual polish, Allam the UI/graphics quality. Its flow is deliberately different from the web application (after front-end team input), not a reused structure. Detailed feedback to follow. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.4 Guest Mobile App — Revised Design Walkthrough · DI-1086)*
- Every web product and flow stays bookable in the mobile app (incl. cabanas, surf, 2D/3D stadium, theatre plan, bus route map), each with its own step order; a toggle switches back to one decision per screen. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — All web products and flows available · DI-1084)*
- Mobile app must not open straight into booking (client found it unclear). Tabs: Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references), with a persistent "Buy tickets" button on every screen (raised centre button, or floating / flat per venue). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tabs Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets, persistent Buy tickets · DI-1081)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Optional intro video on opening the app, with a "Skip introduction" control. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1020)*
- A persistent "Buy tickets" button appears on every screen of the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1017)*
- Mobile tabs: Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1016)*
- The current mobile build goes straight into the booking journey and the client finds it unclear: redesign the UI. All web products and flows, including cabanas and surf, must remain available. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1015)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Accreditation is primarily completed in the web portal (document upload and photo checks suit a larger screen); the same submission is also available in the guest mobile app as a secondary option for individuals. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.8 Accreditation Channel Placement & API Access · DI-666)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

**4 more name particular screens** and are in each screen's block above (*Client meeting inputs*).

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```json
{
"getGuestMenu": {"method":"GET","path":"/outlets/{outletId}/guest-menu","contract":"fnb","summary":"The menu a guest sees","permission":null,"offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"venue","parameters":[{"name":"at","in":"query","required":null},{"name":"language","in":"query","required":null}],"requestBody":null,"responds":"GuestMenu"},

}
```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.

```json
