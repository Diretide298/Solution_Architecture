## Who this is for

**guest on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 11 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, GUEST_MANAGE, GUEST_VIEW, MARKETING_VIEW, ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_VIEW, PAYMENT_VIEW, PRICE_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW, WALLET_OPERATE, WALLET_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **3 of these operations work offline**: listLoyaltyProgrammes, listProducts, listPromotions
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GST-011` | Wallet Overview | A | 0 | 28 | 6 | 30 | 14 | 6 | guest | notStarted (designed) |
| `GST-015` | Memberships | A | 10 | 72 | 6 | 53 | 7 | 0 | guest | notStarted (designed) |
| `GST-036` | Loyalty & Rewards | A | 0 | 30 | 6 | 52 | 2 | 2 | guest | notStarted (designed) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**GST-011, GST-036 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `GST-011` Wallet Overview

**The screen this app sits on. Everything else is entered from here and returns to it.**

| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Membership, Loyalty & Value · wave 2 · needs the `retail` module |

| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `listWalletTransactions` reads the population and `getWallet` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** Balances and stored cards already loaded stay visible with their age, cards masked. Storing a card and transferring value need the server. |
| Opens with | `subjectId` (GST-001), `walletId` (navigation) · cold entry: Resolves from the session; a cold arrival is the ordinary case. |
| Route | `/general/wallet-overview` |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Data it reads**: `getWallet` (onLoad, Read a guest wallet); `listWalletTransactions` (onLoad, Wallet transaction history); `getWalletAutoReloadSetting` (onLoad, Show auto top-up); `getWalletExitBalance` (onLoad, Balance due / refundable at exit)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `GST-020` Saved Items / Wishlist: *Saved items carry across sessions*; carries `subjectId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The wallet overview list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the wallet overview untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No wallet overview yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Never shown: `listWalletTransactions` takes no filter, so an empty list is always the first-run state above. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `WALLET_VIEW`, which `getWallet` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** Balances and stored cards already loaded stay visible with their age, cards masked. Storing a card and transferring value need the server. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 Nothing is due or refundable, or the action does not match the balance (`collect` on a wallet in credit), or `waive` by a guest.; 409 The venue has auto-reload disabled for this wallet type, or the wallet is suspended or closed.; 422 An amount outside the venue's funding rules, or a payment token that is not the holder's.; 422 The card was declined, or `waive` without a reason. |

#### Permissions

- `getWallet` → `WALLET_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `listWalletTransactions` → `WALLET_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `getWalletAutoReloadSetting` → `WALLET_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `setWalletAutoReloadSetting` → `WALLET_OPERATE` (operate) · staff, guest
- `getWalletExitBalance` → `WALLET_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `settleWalletAtExit` → `WALLET_OPERATE` (operate) · staff, guest

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `WALLET_VIEW`, which `getWallet` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

30 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Peer-to-peer transfer from one guest's wallet to another guest's wallet; a configurable venue-level toggle (allowed or not), not a default feature. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.10 Transfers, Fraud/Risk Controls · DI-536)*
- Two variants: monetary gift card (value usable on anything the venue offers) and product-specific gift voucher (redeemable only for a named product, e.g. a dolphin-show voucher). Redemption channel is configurable: online, on-site or both. *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.9 Gift Cards, Vouchers & Wallet Payments · DI-533)*
- Balance can move between linked family/group wallets in either direction (parent to child, child to parent); a venue-controlled toggle, not always enabled. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.8 Shared wallet transfer · DI-532)*
- Guests can create family-member profiles themselves and set spending limits directly from their own guest account, in addition to venue-side configuration. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.8 Family, Parent-Child & Corporate Wallets · DI-530)*
- A parent's wallet funds linked child wristbands/wallets with per-child spending allowances, e.g. of a AED 500 family balance one child is capped at AED 200 and another at AED 200. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.8 Family, Parent-Child & Corporate Wallets · DI-529)*
- Consumption is fully automatic FEFO (nearest expiry first). Guests see their balance and the expiry breakdown per top-up lot in their profile but cannot choose which lot is drawn down; no lot picker at payment. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.6 Stored Value, Credit Consumption & FEFO Logic · DI-523)*
- Guests must be able to configure auto-reload and recurring funding schedules themselves in the guest web/app, not only venue admins in the back office. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding / 5. Key Decisions · DI-519)*
- Top-up rules set minimum and maximum amounts per transaction; channel/funding-source mapping restricts which payment methods each channel offers (e.g. cash top-up on-site only, not online), so each channel's top-up screen offers only its allowed methods. *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding, Top-Up & Reload Management · DI-517)*
- Ownership and access rules are configurable per wallet type. Family default: only the parent/guardian can top up; children can view balance and transactions and spend, but cannot top up unless permissions are explicitly reconfigured. Guest wallet screens must hide or disable top-up for members without the right. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.2 Wallet Ownership / 4.8 Family Permission Rules · DI-509)*
- Wallet type library: multiple wallet types (guest, family, membership wallet), each assigned to a category (individual, corporate, member). Provisioning rules set the trigger that creates a wallet (membership purchase, first top-up); two patterns: gift-card style (pre-defined value products listed on the website) and open-ended "add money to wallet". *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.2 Wallet Type Library, Ownership & Account Association · DI-508)*
- Referral rewards may be credited as currency/points directly into the guest's wallet (like Swiggy), in addition to discount vouchers — a business-configurable option. *(agreed · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.7 Entitlements & Access Control; 5. Key Decisions · DI-460)*
- A combo product can bundle admission with stored-value credit the guest draws down on F&B or retail purchases (wallet mechanics in a dedicated session). *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.7 Entitlements & Access Control · DI-459)*
- Wallet balance is shared across a linked family — a parent's top-up can be drawn down by a linked child's wristband without a separate top-up. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.1 CRM; 4.5 Loyalty, Membership & Wallet · DI-374)*
- Guest profile shows gift vouchers and a stored-value "money card"/wallet; "My Tickets" (all tickets) is separate from "My Reservations" (bookings holding one or more tickets) with reservation details and date modification. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-199)*

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

- **A88** Design the CRM profile & field architecture (user-defined fields, per-field unique/required flags, either-email-or-mobile rule, group profiles, family/guardian linking with shared wallet) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S10 (decision log, for TICVAI's review) · 20 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'wallet')*
- **A125** Extend the preview/publish step to render PDF ticket and Apple/Google Wallet formats, not only the B2C web preview *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S10 (decision log, for TICVAI's review) · 25 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'wallet')*
- **A132** Build the entitlement engine (entry counts, time-bound product windows from first scan, combo redemption by QR at each counter, stored-value credit, referral-to-wallet option) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 25 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'wallet')*
- **A137** Configure product-level stored value (minimum value, maximum balance, balance expiry, refund destination) *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 27 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'stored value')*
- **A159** Build the wallet foundation & dashboard (wallet type library by category, provisioning triggers, gift-card-style vs. add-money patterns, live balance/spend/recharge totals) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 27 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'wallet')*
- **A160** Record wallet balances against the chart of accounts (load booked as customer liability, recognised to product revenue on consumption, every wallet transaction mapped to a GL entry) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 27 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'wallet')*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `GST-020`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 14 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.

### `GST-015` Memberships

**Find memberships for this venue.**

| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `listDelegations` reads the population and `getMyMemberships` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Opens with | `guestLinkId` (deepLink), `subjectId` (GST-001), `caseId` (navigation), `statementId` (navigation) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared ticket, a forwarded confirmation … |
| Route | `/general/memberships` |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. Membership. **`listDelegations` and `grantDelegation` are the member list and add-member** Pranay asked for — CF-132 built them as delegated authority rather than a household table. **Rewired on the 20 August review.** **`getGuestLink` restored** — F19 step 1 calls it from here and my rewire dropped it. **A membership that works in another country resolves through the guest link**, and the flow checker caught what the screen edit did not. **Cross-platform navigation removed 24 August**: ADM-003. **A till does not navigate to a back office and a guest app does not navigate to either** — those are device handovers, and a flow declares them with `crossesDevice` rather than a screen pretending there is a link. **Wired 24 August from review**: getSubscription, listSubscriptionInvoices. **The operations existed and this screen could not call them** — reviewers reported them as missing APIs, which is what an unreachable operation looks like from a wireframe. **`getSubscription` and `listSubscriptionInvoices` removed the same day they were wired.** `check-screens` refused them: **both carry a staff permission and this is a guest surface.** The reviewer asked for `GET /memberships/current` — a guest-scoped read that does not exist. **That is the correct finding and the wiring was the wrong fix**: it is a new operation, not a missing link. **`getGuestLink` is `service` audience** — a cross-region pseudonymous …

53 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Account → Membership → Billing statement shows a line-by-line statement with states: soft decline (Retry now + Use another card), hard decline (Use another card only), declined again (Use another card + next automatic retry date), paid ("Your membership continues"). Use another card lists saved cards. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, 2. Billing statement and payment retry (WEB-023) · DI-1036)*
- Season and membership packages show a quantity stepper once selected. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Cart 12. No quantity field for the selected ticket · DI-980)*
- UX reference: House of Wisdom (Sharjah library) meeting-room/"pod" booking and tiered membership plans — a simple duration-based booking flow without fixed performances/time slots — to be reviewed by Chinmay/Aishwarya. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 6. Open Items · DI-506)*
- Membership lifecycle: upgrade, downgrade, suspend (freezes validity until re-enabled), deactivate and cancel, with configurable timing windows (e.g. upgrade allowed only in the final two months before expiry). *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.8 Eligibility Rules, Special Products & Memberships · DI-467)*
- Membership/pass tickets: seasonal, monthly or annual classes with renewal/auto-renewal using a tokenised card-on-file billed ahead of expiry, subject to the guest's consent to terms and conditions. *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.3 Ticket Type Deep-Dive · DI-448)*
- Membership screen: membership ID, validity, entitlements (free entry, F&B offers, etc.), linked members (view), membership card, renewal and history. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-201)*
- Membership / season pass is defined by start/end date rather than quantity, requires customer profile capture at purchase, and supports renew, upgrade, cancel and extend workflows. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 4. Ticket Catalogue & Product Types · DI-138)*

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (10), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (72 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-015?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Grant delegation, Retry my dunning payment.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `ADM-003`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 7 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `GST-036` Loyalty & Rewards

**Your points, your tier, and what is within reach.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Membership, Loyalty & Value · wave 2 · needs the `marketing` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #18198 (APP-MOB-GST-036) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `listLoyaltyProgrammes` reads the population and `getLoyaltyPosition` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** The last known balance stays with its age, and **points earned since are not shown** — and that is said. Redeeming and referring need the connection. |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/loyalty-rewards` |

**What the spec says about it.** Merged with GST-064 on 18 August. **I created GST-064 in the parity sweep without noticing this screen existed** — same two operations, same capability, and the fuzzy match against the client storyboard is what surfaced it. Board 6 panel 6 shows one Loyalty & Rewards screen, not two. **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added evaluatePromotions, listPromotions. **The same screen on web and app was calling different operations** — one side could do something the other could not, and nothing recorded the difference as deliberate. **Pull audit, 27 September**: evaluatePromotions removed again. It evaluates a cart — `EvaluatePromotionsRequest` requires venueId, channel and at least one line — and this screen has no cart: no entry params, nothing in a basket. The parity pass copied it across without asking what it would be sent. Promotions are evaluated where the cart is.

**Known gaps.** **`getLoyaltyPosition` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Programme | picker: choose a programme | — | — | `getLoyaltyPosition` ?programmeId |
| Status | select | — | Draft · Scheduled · Live · Paused · Expired · Ended | `listPromotions` ?status |
| Active at | date and time picker | — | — | `listPromotions` ?activeAt |

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Loyalty position** (detail panel, from `getLoyaltyPosition`): Shows `subjectId`, `programmeId`, `pointsBalance`, `pointsPending`, `tier`, `nextTier`, `pointsToNextTier`, `expiringPoints`, `expiringAt` from `getLoyaltyPosition`'s inline response. **The response has no named schema**, so this cannot bind until the contract names one.

**Data it reads**: `getLoyaltyPosition` (onLoad, A guest's points, tier and what is within reach); `listLoyaltyProgrammes` (onLoad, List loyalty programmes); `listPromotions` (onLoad, List promotions); `decideRecommendations` (onLoad, Recommendation slot (homepage / loyalty placement …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-001` Home: *Home – Default*
- → `WEB-024` Devices, Wishlist & Consent: *They see rewards and manage their devices*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The loyalty rewards list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the loyalty rewards untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No loyalty rewards yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Never shown: `listLoyaltyProgrammes` takes no filter, so an empty list is always the first-run state above. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `MARKETING_VIEW`, which `listLoyaltyProgrammes` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** The last known balance stays with its age, and **points earned since are not shown** — and that is said. Redeeming and referring need the connection. |

52 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Gamification shows badges/status tiers (e.g. Explorer, Adventurer, Legend) earned by spend or engagement thresholds, feeding the loyalty tier structure. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.9 Surveys & Gamification · DI-392)*
- **Open question.** Loyalty accrues points by product/spend tier (e.g. bronze/silver/gold thresholds) and unlocks tier benefits (e.g. platinum-tier discounts on F&B and ticketing). Full programme configuration (tiers, points, redemption, expiry) pending a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.5 Loyalty, Membership & Wallet · DI-382)*

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

- **A94** Hold the loyalty workshop and define the full programme configuration (tiers, point accrual, redemption, expiry, benefit unlocks) *(Allam / Chinmay Parab · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S14 (weekly tracker) · 20 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'loyalty')*
- **A134** Build the eligibility rules engine (residency/nationality with ID capture, minimum age by DOB, VIP-only profiles, loyalty-points thresholds, purchase limits per order/guest/category/channel) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 25 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker · keyword 'loyalty')*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (0), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (403).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (30 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-036?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] The screen has no action of its own; nothing is drawn as a button that does nothing.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`, `WEB-024`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 2 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Never configurable:** The *Powered by TICVAI* credit in the footer is fixed and never client-editable (MoM 3 Aug, DI-111; MoM 12 Aug, DI-250). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P02 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Mobile App v4.dc.html`: Mobile App v4, the newest guest look (29 September, with the 30 September feedback in the booking flows). It replaces the 28 September Mobile v2 build.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the booking engine that runs inside the app. Keep both files in the same folder.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P02 Guest App

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Products can be presented in multiple card layout styles: carousel, video poster, split, etc. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1089)*
- The home-screen navigation bar layout is configurable: home/explore/map/buy-tickets in different arrangements. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1087)*
- The revised mobile app design is approved in direction: Qossai liked the opening video and visual polish, Allam the UI/graphics quality. Its flow is deliberately different from the web application (after front-end team input), not a reused structure. Detailed feedback to follow. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.4 Guest Mobile App — Revised Design Walkthrough · DI-1086)*
- Every web product and flow stays bookable in the mobile app (incl. cabanas, surf, 2D/3D stadium, theatre plan, bus route map), each with its own step order; a toggle switches back to one decision per screen. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — All web products and flows available · DI-1084)*
- Mobile app must not open straight into booking (client found it unclear). Tabs: Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references), with a persistent "Buy tickets" button on every screen (raised centre button, or floating / flat per venue). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tabs Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets, persistent Buy tickets · DI-1081)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Optional intro video on opening the app, with a "Skip introduction" control. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1020)*
- A persistent "Buy tickets" button appears on every screen of the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1017)*
- Mobile tabs: Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1016)*
- The current mobile build goes straight into the booking journey and the client finds it unclear: redesign the UI. All web products and flows, including cabanas and surf, must remain available. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1015)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Accreditation is primarily completed in the web portal (document upload and photo checks suit a larger screen); the same submission is also available in the guest mobile app as a secondary option for individuals. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.8 Accreditation Channel Placement & API Access · DI-666)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
