# WS42 — Privacy  Consent   Preference Management board 2

**10 screens · 14 operations · 22 schemas · 4 permissions**

Platform P13 Venue CMS · ships as **venue-management** ·

online only

## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `AUDIT_VIEW, GUEST_MANAGE, GUEST_VIEW, GUEST_VIEW_PII`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers)

Customer & marketing is how a venue knows its guests and talks to them. There is ONE guest profile per person across ticketing, F&B and retail, so a guest who books online and later dines is the same profile (DI-339). A profile needs at least an email or a mobile, never neither (DI-372). Profiles are created by registration, by guest checkout, or by staff at a till or desk. Repeat guest checkouts with the same verified email or phone attach to the same profile automatically (DI-941, R120 default). Two records that might be the same person are NEVER merged automatically: the guest is asked to confirm, and an admin review queue runs alongside (DI-377). Each candidate shows why it matched; the record that loses is superseded, not deleted; consent takes the narrower of the two positions (DI-808). Around the profile sit three things that must never be confused. CONSENT is what the law allows: per purpose and per channel, append-only, with the notice version and the source (recordConsent). It is Given, Withdrawn or Not asked. A SUBSCRIPTION is what the guest asked to receive, e.g. a newsletter list (MarketingSubscription). A PREFERENCE is what they like: table, dietary, accessibility (updateGuestPreferences). An anonymous visitor's cookie decision is recorded against a device key (recordDeviceConsent) and attaches to the guest when they sign in (claimDeviceConsent). Marketing consent at GUEST CHECKOUT is an open client question, and the design follows its default: an unticked opt-in beside the terms, one per channel and purpose. It is recorded with source "checkout" against the order and the verified contact, and nothing is sent without it. Whether that is sufficient consent under PDPL is the client DPO's call (M18-15 (audit R-M18-15), DI-954, DI-940). Marketing reads profiles through SEGMENTS (rules, evaluated when used) and static LISTS (imported). It reaches guests by CAMPAIGNS (one send to an audience) and JOURNEYS (automations started by an event, with waits and branches). Journeys may offer only pre-configured offers, never a free-typed discount (MoM 2026-08-20 4.6). Everything goes through ONE communications module that every other module uses (MoM 2026-08-31 4.6). Consent and suppression are applied at send time, and the number excluded, with the reasons, is reported before anything goes out (launchCampaign). Transactional messages (tickets, receipts, queue calls, case replies) do not need marketing consent and must never carry marketing. LOYALTY pays for spend: points, tiers, rewards and expiry. GAMIFICATION pays for behaviour: challenges, badges, streaks, referrals and leaderboards (createChallenge). A guest reads their own loyalty position (getLoyaltyPosition). A till, the back office or support reads a named guest's (getGuestLoyalty, or identifyGuest at a till). SERVICE: one Case object covers lost property, complaints, questions, accessibility and refund requests (CaseKind). A guest raises one with raiseMyCase, which needs the connection …

| Say | Meaning | Never say | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Guest | The person the venue serves, signed in or not. In body copy on every surface. | Customer, User, Subject, Contact, Patron | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/GuestProfile |
| Guest profile | The CRM record of one person (details, consent, preferences, history). Distinct from the Account, which is how a guest signs in. | Customer record, Contact, Subject | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#getGuestProfile |
| Consent - Given / Withdrawn / Not asked | What the law allows, per purpose (marketing, personalisation, profiling, third-party sharing, AI processing, transactional) and per channel. "Not asked" is not "Withdrawn" and must look different. | Opted in/out as a status, Accepted, Declined, Revoked, Unsubscribed (that is a subscription) | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/ConsentDecision |
| Subscription | A list the guest asked to receive (a newsletter, event news), per channel. Unsubscribing from a list is not withdrawing consent. | Consent, Opt-in | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/MarketingSubscription |
| Preferences | What the guest likes or needs (seating, drinks, dietary, accessibility, contact channel). Never grants permission. | Consents, Settings | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#updateGuestPreferences |
| Send me offers and news | The marketing opt-in label beside the terms at checkout, unticked, one per channel and purpose. | I agree to marketing, Pre-ticked boxes, Keep me updated ticked by default | DI-954 |
| Points / Tier / Points to next tier / Expiring points | The loyalty position. Points are a liability earned per programme; tiers are ranked (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum in the meetings). | Credits, Coins, Balance alone (wallet money is "credit"), Level | DI-382 |
| Pending points | Points earned on a purchase still inside its refund window; shown apart from spendable points. | Available points for pending ones | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#getLoyaltyPosition |
| Reward | What points can be turned into (rewards catalogue). | Prize (games redemption uses prize), Voucher unless it is one | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#listRewards |
| Challenge / Badge / Streak / Referral | Gamification - rewards for behaviour, not spend. Status badges such as Explorer, Adventurer, Legend. | Mission and Quest used interchangeably on one screen, Loyalty tier for a badge | DI-392 |
| Case | One service record - lost property, complaint, question, accessibility, refund request or other - with a number (venue prefix plus sequence), a status and an SLA. | Ticket (a ticket is an admission product), Issue, Incident (that is maintenance and safety) | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/CaseKind |
| Reply to guest / Internal note | The two kinds of case message. The agent always chooses one explicitly; there is no default. | Comment, Message (ambiguous) | F05 step 2 |
| Conversation | A live chat session (web chat, in-app, WhatsApp, SMS, email, kiosk, voice). With the assistant, then queued, then with an agent. It is not a case. | Ticket, Case (until one is raised from it) | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/ConversationState |
| Segment / List / Audience | A segment is rules evaluated when used. A list is static, imported or hand-picked. The audience is what a campaign or journey targets. | Group, Cohort, Target list for a segment | DI-381 |

| Reachable | How many guests in an audience can actually be sent to on a channel after consent and suppression. Always shown beside the matching count. | Audience size alone | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#previewSegment |
| Possible duplicate / Merge | Two profiles that may be one person. Never called "Duplicate" as a verdict. Merging needs confirmation and stays reversible for 30 days. | Duplicate (as a status), Combine, Auto-merge | DI-808 |
| Data request | A guest's privacy request - a copy of my data, a correction, erasure, a restriction - with a legal clock. Statuses submitted, in progress, completed. | DSAR on guest screens, Subject data, Ticket | DI-379 |
| Waiver / Consent question | A waiver is a signed, versioned form. A consent question ("Are you able to swim?", "I accept the risk") is a single question asked per person or per booking and recorded as consent. | Contract, Disclaimer, Form for a waiver in guest copy | DI-1062 |
| Lost item / Found item / Possible match | The two directions of lost property and the suggested pairing between them. | Lost case, Claim before it is claimed | contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/LostItem |

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

## Thin screens in this batch

**CMS-032, CMS-033, CMS-035 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*

- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred.

- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P13 Venue CMS

- The config side panel is a reference tool only, not the CMS. The CMS will be step-based and include header/footer, logos and banners. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W12 Config side panel · DI-1014)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- Qossai: build AI-assisted site design/generation into the website builder, keeping site design (header, footer, color, font, layout) separate from content (tickets), with tickets flowing into the site's structure once published. To be explored. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 7. AI-Assisted Website Generation · DI-115)*
- Qossai: give clients as much design flexibility as possible within the configurable structure. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-114)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*

### Screen by screen

**`CMS-031` Privacy Operations Command Center**

- Workshop packs group screens ten to a board, each opened by a command centre; that grouping is the navigation: the nine detail screens are reached from the board's hub and return to it. *(agreed · screen note 4 Sep 2026, BO-144 and the other board hubs · DI-653)*
