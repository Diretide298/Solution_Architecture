## Who this is for

**partner on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 11 permissions apply here:
  `CAPACITY_CONFIGURE, ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_DISCOUNT, ORDER_EXCHANGE, ORDER_MODIFY, ORDER_REPRINT, ORDER_RESCHEDULE, ORDER_VIEW, ORDER_VOID, PRICE_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.

## The screens

| id | name | pattern | ops | overlays | machine |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PTR-005` | Inventory & Allocation View | listDetail | 16 | 9 | — |
| `PTR-006` | Product Catalog (B2B Pricing) | listDetail | 8 | 0 | — |
| `PTR-007` | Availability Search | statusTracker | 1 | 0 | — |

## Thin screens in this batch

**PTR-007 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P10 Partner Web

- **Open question.** Qossai proposes a POS-style interface for high-volume resellers (hotels, travel agents) instead of a B2C-style site with login: assigned tickets and partner prices after login, optional cash drawer, sent-ticket history and resend, balance view. Chinmay wireframes both options; decide after review. *(open · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 3. B2B / reseller portal · DI-1023)*
- Qossai: partners may use the TICVAI B2B portal directly with a white-label-style B2B credential (similar to B2C), or integrate via API (preferred for OTAs such as Ticketmaster, Platinum List, BookMyShow). *(agreed · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.3 Clarified (integration models) · DI-552)*
- Partner access controls define which actions a partner may perform (e.g. refund, reschedule); the partner portal should only offer the actions granted. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2B Reseller & OTA Partner Management · DI-551)*
- Allam: B2B Portal option — partners without their own platform use a TICVAI B2B portal structured like the B2C store but behind login credentials, showing pre-configured partner pricing and products, with commission tracked the same way. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 2. B2B Ticket Distribution Models · DI-134)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*

### Screen by screen

**`PTR-005` Inventory & Allocation View**

- Partner screens never create products, prices or performances: the product catalogue (B2B pricing) is read only and the inventory view keeps its reads; partners see assigned products and partner prices. *(agreed · Decisions Register 29 Sep 2026, Rev 3 prototype feedback — M17-04 (partner API scope) · DI-1079)*
- Partners never create products, prices or capacity: partner catalogue and inventory screens are read-only (a partner may still return its own unsold allocation). *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, M17-04 · DI-930)*
- Inventory can be reserved for a specific partner; booking limits cap tickets per transaction or transactions per day, per partner or overall. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.4 B2B Commercial Agreements, Credit & Payment Models · DI-556)*

**`PTR-006` Product Catalog (B2B Pricing)**

- Partner screens never create products, prices or performances: the product catalogue (B2B pricing) is read only and the inventory view keeps its reads; partners see assigned products and partner prices. *(agreed · Decisions Register 29 Sep 2026, Rev 3 prototype feedback — M17-04 (partner API scope) · DI-1079)*

A guest buying the second and being sold the first has bought the wrong ticket.\n**Transport uses two existing kinds, not a new one** (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-21). A one-way trip is `timedAdmission`: `transport.createTransportRoute` creates the route's product with one variant per passenger type, and each departure is a performance. A multi-trip or unlimited pass is `openDated`: `transport.createTransportPassType` creates it, with `EntitlementTemplate.entriesAllowed` = the pass's trips (null for unlimited), the validity = `validityDays`, and `EntitlementTemplate.transportRestriction` naming the station pair the pass was bought for, so `access` refuses it on another journey. The sale path is unchanged: both are cart lines, priced by `transport.quoteTransportFare` (orders `TransportLineAttributes`).\n",
