## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 11 permissions apply here:
  `APPROVAL_DECIDE, AUDIT_VIEW, DEVICE_MANAGE, DEVICE_VIEW, ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_VIEW, REPORT_MANAGE, REPORT_VIEW_VENUE, SCOPE_VIEW, TENANT_CONFIGURE, WORKSTATION_CONFIGURE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `BO-129` Software, Configuration & Version Management

**Software, Configuration & Version Management — from the client design board, 20 August.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Venue Operations · wave 2 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `DEVICE_MANAGE`, `DEVICE_VIEW`, `SCOPE_VIEW`, `TENANT_CONFIGURE`, `WORKSTATION_CONFIGURE` (3 configure, 2 read); in the flows as technician |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `listWorkstations` reads the population and `getWorkstationHealth` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `venueId` (session), `profileId` (deepLink), `workstationId` (deepLink), `rolloutId` (navigation), `firmwareId` (navigation) · cold entry: Resolves from the session. A principal with more than one venue is asked which first. Resolves from the session — a till is signed into. |
| Route | `/venue-operations/software-configuration-version-management` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Added 20 August from the client design board.** The operations existed and no screen called them. **Owns POS board frame(s) POS-5D** (client pack, 24 August). **Assigned by board purpose rather than by operation overlap** — three attempts at deriving that mapping produced plausible nonsense, and a reader who trusts a bad table is worse off than one who has none.

**Known gaps.** **`getWorkstationHealth` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

**Data it reads**: `listWorkstations` (onLoad, List workstations); `listDeviceFirmware` (onLoad, Firmware versions per device fleet)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-130` Offline Policy & Rules Configuration: *Offline Policy & Rules Configuration*
- → `BO-108` Venue Operations: *Venue Operations*
- → `BO-037` Offline Package Status: *Each device's cached package is checked*; carries `version`; calls `setConnectivityThresholds`
- → `BO-124` Layout & Journey Builder: *Its sale board layout is built*; carries `profileId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The software version list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the software version untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No software version yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches the filter on venueId, saleBoardKind and the software version are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `DEVICE_VIEW`, which `getWorkstationHealth` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 A release with this `deviceKind` and `version` already exists; 409 A shift is open on this workstation. The change is not applied; it can be made once the shift has closed.; 409 The firmware named by `firmwareId` is not `released` |

#### Permissions

- `setConfigurationProfile` → `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff
- `deployConfigurationProfile` → `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff
- `configureWorkstation` → `WORKSTATION_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff
- `getWorkstationHealth` → `DEVICE_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listWorkstations` → `SCOPE_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `setConnectivityThresholds` → `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff

- `createDeviceFirmware` → `DEVICE_MANAGE` (configure) · staff
- `getDeviceFirmware` → `DEVICE_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `setDeviceFirmwareStatus` → `DEVICE_MANAGE` (configure) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `DEVICE_VIEW`, which `getWorkstationHealth` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

21 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Firmware: package library per device; compatibility rules limit deployment to compatible models; update wizard with phased/scheduled rollout; live monitor flags failures (e.g. device offline at deployment); rollback and update history. *(client request · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.7 Firmware & Software Management · DI-903)*
- Remote configuration deploys a device type's settings (e.g. receipt printers) to many workstations in one action; configuration versions can be compared and rolled back. *(client request · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.4 Device Inventory, Configuration Templates & Driver Management · DI-898)*
- Versioned configuration profiles with deployments: board 1F shows 1,248 workstations across four configuration versions. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Genuine functional gaps - 1F · DI-404)*
- Software configuration tracks software version and pending/completed updates per workstation. *(client request · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 11. Wireframe Walkthrough — Workstation, Till & POS Management · DI-305)*

Also apply: 1 for P08 · Venue Operations, 24 for all of P08, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

### `BO-130` Offline Policy & Rules Configuration

**Offline Policy & Rules Configuration — from the client design board, 20 August.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Venue Operations · wave 1 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `ORDER_CREATE`, `ORDER_VIEW`, `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (1 operate, 1 read, 1 configure); in the flows as cashier, technician |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `listSyncRejections` reads a population and nothing reads one of them; the detail is the row until a `get` exists |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `venueId` (session) · cold entry: Resolves from the session. A principal with more than one venue is asked which first. |
| Route | `/venue-operations/offline-policy-rules-configuration` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Added 20 August from the client design board.** The operations existed and no screen called them. **Owns POS board frame(s) POS-5E** (client pack, 24 August). **Assigned by board purpose rather than by operation overlap** — three attempts at deriving that mapping produced plausible nonsense, and a reader who trusts a bad table is worse off than one who has none. **Moved to wave 1 on 24 August.** F33 walks a till going offline and coming back, which is a wave-1 journey — ADR-0013 makes the POS local-first from the first release. **A venue that can trade offline and cannot resolve a sync rejection has an unbounded journal and no way to clear it**, and `check-flows` refused the flow rather than let that ship. **Resolved remotely by design.** is venue-scoped and this is a web screen — **a supervisor at the main venue clears a mall kiosk's rejections without going there.** An IT technician restores the connection; **deciding whether a sale stands is a commercial act and they have the access without the authority.**

- Flow F33 *A till goes offline and comes back*, step 7: Four transactions are rejected — a product retired while the till was offline. → **Rejected, not discarded.** A sale that happened is a sale, and the guest has the goods — the rejection is a reconciliation task, not a reversal.
- Flow F33 *A till goes offline and comes back*, step 8: The supervisor resolves each one. → Posted against the retired product at the price the guest paid. **The catalogue moved and the transaction did not** — repricing it now would change what was charged.

### `BO-131` Connectivity & Auto-Switch Settings

**Connectivity & Auto-Switch Settings — from the client design board, 20 August.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Venue Operations · wave 2 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (1 configure) |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | configEditor (compact density): the screen declares only writes (`setConnectivityThresholds`) and no read of a population — it is settings, not a list |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `venueId` (session) · cold entry: Resolves from the session. A principal with more than one venue is asked which first. |

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-108` Venue Operations: *Venue Operations*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The saved connectivity auto-switch settings. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the connectivity auto-switch settings untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No connectivity auto-switch settings configured. The form opens empty and `setConnectivityThresholds` saves the first one; it says what the platform does in the meantime. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `TENANT_CONFIGURE`, which `setConnectivityThresholds` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Permissions

- `setConnectivityThresholds` → `TENANT_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `TENANT_CONFIGURE`, which `setConnectivityThresholds` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

2 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.3.1 | The system should support offline mode for POS and Kiosk: - Ability to switch automatically to offline mode in case of server outage / network loss - Definition of which functionality will be lost in … | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | `syncOrders` |
| 2.14.2 | For all sales at POS, it is possible to have an offline mode. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | `syncOrders` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Offline mode switches on automatically when connectivity is lost; each offline-capable node sells from a pre-allocated quota (e.g. 100 tickets per node) that is reallocated after reconnect and sync. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 8. Offline Selling Rules · DI-142)*
- After reconnection, offline records sync in batches in the order events occurred, tagged with both the original recorded time and the sync time; syncing must not slow gate entry. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 7. Ticket Validation & Offline Architecture · DI-065)*

### `BO-133` Offline Alerts, Limits & Audit

**Offline Alerts, Limits & Audit — from the client design board, 20 August.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Venue Operations · wave 1 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #17826 (APP-SETUP-BO-133) |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `APPROVAL_DECIDE`, `AUDIT_VIEW`, `ORDER_VIEW`, `REPORT_MANAGE`, `REPORT_VIEW_VENUE` (2 operate, 2 read, 1 configure); in the flows as cashier |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | approvalInbox (compact density): `decideApprovalRequest` decides items that `listSyncRejections` queues — every row is waiting for a person, so the empty state is success |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `venueId` (session), `reportId` (deepLink), `requestId` (deepLink) · cold entry: Resolves from the session. A principal with more than one venue is asked which first. An approval request opened from the queue. |
| Route | `/venue-operations/offline-alerts-limits-audit` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Added 20 August from the client design board.** The operations existed and no screen called them. **Named in the board contents and not written up in it** — the operations are real, the layout is not. **Owns POS board frame(s) POS-5F** (client pack, 24 August). **Assigned by board purpose rather than by operation overlap** — three attempts at deriving that mapping produced plausible nonsense, and a reader who trusts a bad table is worse off than one who has none. **Moved to wave 1 on 24 August.** F33 walks a till going offline and coming back, which is a wave-1 journey — ADR-0013 makes the POS local-first from the first release. **A venue that can trade offline and cannot resolve a sync rejection has an unbounded journal and no way to clear it**, and `check-flows` refused the flow rather than let that ship.

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-108` Venue Operations: *Venue Operations*
- → `POS-002` Sell — Ticket Catalogue: *The connection returns*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The offline alerts limits list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the offline alerts limits untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Nothing is waiting, which is the good outcome.** An empty queue means every item has been decided; it offers no create action, because creating work is not what it needs. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches the filter on workstationId, kind, resolved and the offline alerts limits are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `listSyncRejections` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 An `outsideRange` rule without both `threshold` and `thresholdUpper`, or with the upper not above the lower (audit R158); 400 Required parameter missing, or the date range exceeds `maxDateRangeDays` (366 days when the definition sets none, audit R158); 409 The request is no longer open for a decision. `refusedReason` says which: `alreadyDecided` (approved or rejected), `withdrawn`, `expired` … |

#### Permissions

- `listSyncRejections` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listAlerts` → `REPORT_VIEW_VENUE` (operate) · staff
- `listAuditRecords` → `AUDIT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `decideApprovalRequest` → `APPROVAL_DECIDE` (operate) · staff, public
- `runReport` → `REPORT_VIEW_VENUE` (operate) · staff, partner
- `setAlertRule` → `REPORT_MANAGE` (configure) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `listSyncRejections` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

14 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P08 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/5-venue-management/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html`: the client-approved POS, for operator density and components.
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html`: for finish and motion.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-030, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-041, DI-042, DI-043, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051, DI-052 (each is in the design inputs below).

**Workshop tracker rows about P08 as a whole** (1: 1 open, 0 closed). Open first; a closed row says where it went on 30 September.

- **S8** Venue Management back-end configuration wireframes *(Chinmay Parab · In progress · due Fri 2 Oct · 30 Sep 2026 · 30 Sep tracker)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*

- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*

Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*

- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred.

- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P08 Venue Management

- Qossai: configuration screens should consolidate related functionality, potentially merging 3-4 previously separate screens into one, rather than the repetitive one-screen-per-concept pattern of the AI-built reference system. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.5 Screen Consolidation Philosophy · DI-987)*
- **Open question.** Open: should AI monitoring live in one centralised AI command dashboard or be distributed as widgets in each functional module's own dashboard? Allam: Softlabs' call; the current proposal is illustrative and Softlabs may propose a better structure. *(open · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.4 AI Governance — Risk, Compliance & Continuous Monitoring · DI-936)*
- Simulation functionality stays embedded within each relevant configuration section rather than being consolidated, since it tests that section's own configuration. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-722)*
- Client boards (POS Frontline, F&B, Retail, Inventory & Procurement) share one architecture: six boards of ten screens per domain, a command centre first and an AI/analytics board last, under the hierarchy Company > Venue > Department > Workstation > Operator/Shift > Transaction > Exception > Reconciliation > Analytics. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Opening / What the boards give us · DI-400)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- **Open question.** Allam: a user's visibility must be restrictable to specific outlets (an F&B manager of one outlet should not see other outlets' items); also relevant for ticketing/event-specific access. Implementation approach still open. *(open · MoM 18 Aug 2026, 4.6 Role-Based & Outlet-Level Access Control — Open Item · DI-331)*
- Access loads automatically at login on POS and web/admin. A user with one role logs straight in; a user with several roles (e.g. admin, cashier, supervisor, manager) is prompted to choose which role to use. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 4. Multiple Roles per User and Role Switching · DI-249)*
- Back office is role-driven from any device: a finance user signing in from a workstation, laptop or home sees only finance reports and related information. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 3. Role-Based Access and Workstation-Linked Front-End · DI-248)*
- Built-in help menu with step-by-step tutorials with screenshots for common tasks (e.g. how to sell a ticket at the POS). *(client request · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 8. Legacy POS Layout Designer & System Logging · DI-160)*
- Custom data-capture fields ("data mask") at account, event, extended-ticket and product level: field types text, dropdown, radio, true/false; multi-language labels; validation (min/max length, required/optional); reusable value lists (e.g. country list). Standard fields come out of the box. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 6. Data Mask: Flexible Custom Data Capture · DI-155)*
- Load/traffic dashboards respect the tenancy model: a venue manager sees traffic for their own venue only. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-061)*
- Allam: queue management is built into the system (not third-party) so traffic entering the site can be throttled from the back office itself. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-060)*
- **Open question.** Proposed tenant hierarchy Tenant > Organization/Brand > Region > Branch > Venue > Department, under review against TICVAI's own organisational hierarchy before finalising. *(open · MoM 30 Jul 2026, 2. Proposed Multi-Tenant Hierarchy · DI-055)*
- Documentation deliverable includes user guides and help content; the preview shows a TICVAI Help Center with categories (Getting Started, Events, Tickets, Orders, Payments, Memberships, Access Control, Reports, Integrations), a "Welcome to TICVAI" getting-started article and Quick Links (Create an Event, Set Pricing, Manage Access, View Reports). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - What We Deliver / Key Deliverables Preview · DI-052)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- AI Assistant panel: a short framing ("Based on last 30 days, here are 3 actions that can improve your revenue") then actionable recommendations, each with its potential impact (e.g. "Increase pricing for VIP seats, +12%") and a chevron, plus "View all recommendations". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - AI Panels · DI-043)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Back-office shell: collapsible left sidebar with Overview, Events, Tickets, Orders, Customers, Memberships, Access Control, POS, Reports, Analytics, AI Assistant, Settings, and the signed-in user (name, role) at the bottom; top bar with global search (Cmd+K), current time and date, Notifications with unread dot, and user menu. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 04 Dashboard Vision (p4) - navigation shell · DI-030)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*
- Reports and historical searches must still retrieve archived transactions when required; the retention period (e.g. keep 3 of 5+ years live) is configurable per customer, archival manual or automated. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 23. Database Optimisation and Archiving · DI-018)*
- Back-office controls for the waiting room: configurable maximum active users and admission intervals, set per customer and venue. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 19. Auto-scaling and Virtual Waiting Room · DI-017)*

### In P08 · Venue Operations

- Allam/Qossai: the workstation/till/POS wireframes are reference only (partly ChatGPT-generated, with errors) and not to be replicated; Softlabs may consolidate dashboards freely and must cross-check the functionality matrix for missing items. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 11. Wireframe Walkthrough — Workstation, Till & POS Management · DI-312)*

**12 more name particular screens** and are in each screen's block above (*Client meeting inputs*).

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
