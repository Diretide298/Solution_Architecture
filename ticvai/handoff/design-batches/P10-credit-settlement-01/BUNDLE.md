## Who this is for

**partner on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 2 permissions apply here:
  `ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale)

A guest finds something to do, picks when and how many, holds capacity, pays, and receives a ticket they can show at the gate, transfer or resell. The same booking engine serves the guest website (P01, WEB-), the guest app (P02, GST-) and, through the same catalogue, cart and order operations, the kiosk (P05), the cashier at the till (P04) and the staff handheld (P06); partners book on credit through the partner portal (P10). Guest surfaces are white-label (venue logo, colours, fonts, card layouts, step indicator style, cart placement) with "Powered by TICVAI" kept; the till and handheld stay TICVAI-branded. The booking runs in a fixed order that the client set on 29 September and confirmed on 30 September: for a dated product, the date first, then the time (hidden until a date), then the tickets (hidden until a time); undated products go straight to the tickets; product-first flows (workshops) pick the product, then the date; seated events with one performance open on the seat map, sections first, zoom into a section, pinch out to compare. Choosing a date, time or session commits nothing; capacity is held only when a quantity is set (a 15-minute basket window, 8 minutes for seats and cabanas, one extension). The guest counters (adult, child, senior, infant, person of determination) belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices, so a basket line is "<ticket> · <guest type> × <n>"; group and school products start from group ticket cards and a typed headcount (minus, plus, and +10 on the app), supervisors free. Help me choose filters the catalogue on the server (never a consent step) with Show everything; consent questions such as "Are you able to swim?" are asked once after the session is picked and never again where the page already asked. Sign-in or the six-digit guest code is asked when the guest leaves Add-ons (or at payment, per venue), only the fields the venue configured; after the code, only the T&Cs tick remains (W1). Payment creates the order first and treats an unknown outcome as "checking with your bank", never a second charge; tickets issue on payment, go to Apple or Google Wallet, and a dynamic-QR event's ticket lives in the app. The guest app is deliberately not a copy of the website (30 September): its structure is Home, Explore, Plan and Tickets tabs with a persistent Buy tickets button, item pages that propose the right product (a restaurant's meal combo that includes admission), ride videos that play with no loader, a visit planner that plans each day at one park from that park's rides, dining and shops only, and in-park walking navigation; the booking flow inside it is functionally identical to the web. Vocabulary in guest copy follows the glossary's recorded exceptions (Booking, Session, QR). source: [F01, F02, F03, F07, F49, F52, F55, F57, F58, F59, MoM 29 Sep 1 (W1-W12), MoM 29 Sep 2, MoM 29 Sep 3, MoM 30 Sep 4.4-4.8, CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP 1-6, CLIENT-RESPONSE-REV3-25SEP, REV3-1, REV3-2, REV3-3, REV3-4, REV3-26, DI-1086 …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PTR-012` | Checkout / Credit Purchase | B–D | 21 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 1 | 6 | — | notStarted (generated) |
| `PTR-013` | Credit Limit & Balance | B–D | 0 | 13 | 5 | 5 | 1 | 0 | — | notStarted (generated) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**PTR-013 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `PTR-012` Checkout / Credit Purchase

**Take the money, and be unambiguous about whether it worked.**

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered — sound for a list, a form or a money screen, and worth revisiting where this screen is unusual. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. **The strongest multi-currency case in the platform.** A partner is billed in `PartnerAgreement.settlementCurrency`, which is often not the venue's — a UK operator selling a Dubai attraction is invoiced in GBP against sales booked in AED. **`creditLimit` is in the settlement currency**, so a limit in the wrong currency is a limit that moves with the exchange rate. Which rate converts the sale is `fxPolicy` and it is a commercial term, not a default.

**Known gaps.** Removed 2 October 2026 (CHG-WIR-018): A partner checkout has no tip (design-notes correction ticketing-guest PTR-012).

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Checkout on credit, prepaid wallet or card, in the partner's settlement currency. After Block A.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Raw CreatePaymentRequest text fields and Add tip. (CHG-WIR-018).

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The saved checkout credit purchase. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the checkout credit purchase untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No checkout credit purchase configured. The form opens empty and `createPayment` saves the first one; it says what the platform does in the meantime. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_CREATE`, which `createPayment` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 Only an `authorised` payment is captured (`notAuthorised`). The amount may not exceed what was authorised (`aboveAuthorisedAmount`), and less than that is … (PaymentProblem); 409 Tender unavailable offline (`tenderUnavailableOffline`), amount exceeds the balance due (`exceedsBalanceDue`), or a guest channel sent a tender other than card … (PaymentProblem) |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
checkout: 'AED 5,200 · on credit · available after: AED 13,560'
```

#### Permissions

- `createPayment` → `ORDER_CREATE` (operate) · staff, guest, partner
- `capturePayment` → `ORDER_CREATE` (operate) · staff, partner
- `inquirePaymentStatus` → `ORDER_CREATE` (operate) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_CREATE`, which `createPayment` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

10 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered — sound for a list, a form or a money screen, and worth revisiting where this screen is unusual. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement.

**Known gaps.** Removed 2 October 2026 (CHG-WIR-018): Overriding and setting the credit limit are venue actions; the partner reads (design-notes correction ticketing-guest PTR-013). Removed 2 October 2026 (CHG-WIR-018): Overriding and setting the credit limit are venue actions; the partner reads (design-notes correction ticketing-guest PTR-013).

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Credit limit and balance: limit, used, available, invoices and due dates. After Block A. Read only.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Override credit limit and Save b2b credit limit. (CHG-WIR-018).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**The credit position** (detail panel, from `getB2bCredit`)

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ID | the name it points at, never the id | Added 20 August. The schema reference derives table columns from API response schemas, and a response is not a table — this one returned … |
| Account | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Account name | text | — |
| Credit limit | AED 1,234.50 | On the wire this is three fields; in the database it is one column. 24 August. |
| Used | AED 1,234.50 | On the wire this is three fields; in the database it is one column. 24 August. |

**Data it reads**: `getB2bCredit` (onLoad, from page inventory)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `PTR-001` Partner Login / MFA: *Partner Login / MFA*
- → `PTR-002` Partner Dashboard: *Partner Dashboard*; carries `accountId`, `orderId`
- → `PTR-003` Profile & Company Details: *Profile & Company Details*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The credit limit balance, read by `getB2bCredit`. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the credit limit balance untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No credit limit balance yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `getB2bCredit` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
credit: Limit AED 50,000 · used AED 31,240 · next invoice 31 Oct
```

#### Permissions

- `getB2bCredit` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, partner

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `getB2bCredit` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

5 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.7.19 | The BtoB online orders shall be manageable thanks to the credit account limit. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | `getB2bCredit` |
| 2.7.20 | BtoB online can pay using credit cards. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | `getB2bCredit` |
| 2.7.31 | The system should enable B2B clients, resellers and partners to: - Purchase tickets with their specific pricing channel - Reserve tickets with payment to be made a later time, such as on-site on … | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | `getB2bCredit` |
| 2.7.38 | The system should support: - Activation of tickets only after B2B clients have made payment. - Entry of limits on the quantity of tickets, transactions or amount per day/month allowed by a B2B guest. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | `getB2bCredit` |
| 4.2.23 | The system shall support B2B customer credit accounts with configurable credit limits, available balance tracking, aging reports, payment tracking, and settlement management. | Bundles and Promotions | CONTRACTED | `getB2bCredit` |

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P10 Partner Web

- **Open question.** Qossai proposes a POS-style interface for high-volume resellers (hotels, travel agents) instead of a B2C-style site with login: assigned tickets and partner prices after login, optional cash drawer, sent-ticket history and resend, balance view. Chinmay wireframes both options; decide after review. *(open · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 3. B2B / reseller portal · DI-1023)*
- Qossai: partners may use the TICVAI B2B portal directly with a white-label-style B2B credential (similar to B2C), or integrate via API (preferred for OTAs such as Ticketmaster, Platinum List, BookMyShow). *(agreed · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.3 Clarified (integration models) · DI-552)*
- Partner access controls define which actions a partner may perform (e.g. refund, reschedule); the partner portal should only offer the actions granted. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2B Reseller & OTA Partner Management · DI-551)*
- Allam: B2B Portal option — partners without their own platform use a TICVAI B2B portal structured like the B2C store but behind login credentials, showing pre-configured partner pricing and products, with commission tracked the same way. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 2. B2B Ticket Distribution Models · DI-134)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*

**2 more name particular screens** and are in each screen's block above (*Client meeting inputs*).

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```json
{
"capturePayment": {"method":"POST","path":"/payments/{paymentId}/capture","contract":"orders","summary":"Capture a previously authorised payment","permission":"ORDER_CREATE","offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"workstation","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":null,"responds":"Payment"},
"createPayment": {"method":"POST","path":"/payments","contract":"orders","summary":"Take a payment against an order","permission":"ORDER_CREATE","offlineCapable":true,"conflictPolicy":"append","scopeLevel":"workstation","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":"CreatePaymentRequest","responds":"Payment"},
"getB2bCredit": {"method":"GET","path":"/b2b-accounts/{accountId}/credit","contract":"orders","summary":"Partner credit position","permission":"ORDER_VIEW","offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"venue","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responds":"CreditPosition"},
"inquirePaymentStatus": {"method":"POST","path":"/payments/{paymentId}/inquiry","contract":"orders","summary":"Ask the provider what actually happened","permission":"ORDER_CREATE","offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"workstation","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":null,"responds":"Payment"}
}
```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.

```json
{
"CreatePaymentRequest": {"type":"object","required":["id","orderId","tender","amount","recordedAt"],"properties":{"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid","description":"Client-generated UUIDv7 of the payment, and its idempotency key — it must equal the `Idempotency-Key` header."},"orderId":{"type":"string","format":"uuid"},"tender":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/TenderKind"},"amount":{"$ref":"../shared/common.yaml#/components/schemas/Money"},"tenderCurrency":{"type":"string","pattern":"^[A-Z]{3}$","nullable":true,"description":"The currency the guest handed over, where it is not the venue's — becomes `Payment.tenderCurrency`. Omit for a payment in the venue's own currency.
