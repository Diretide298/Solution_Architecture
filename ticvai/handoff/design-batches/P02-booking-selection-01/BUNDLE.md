## Who this is for

**guest on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 8 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, GUEST_VIEW, ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_MODIFY, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW, RESOURCE_VIEW, VENUE_MAP_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **9 of these operations work offline**: getBundle, getPublishedBookingFlow, getPublishedGuidedChoice, getVenueMap, listBookableVenueMaps, listPerformances, listProductCategories, listProductVariants
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

| `GST-075` | Book a Space by the Hour | A | 23 | 40 | 6 | 25 | 7 | 0 | guest | notStarted (designed) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**GST-048, GST-050, GST-056, GST-058 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `GST-007` Select Date & Time

**Pick a date, then a time that has room; the tickets for it come next.**

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** **Date → time → ticket (REV3-2):** the time sits right after the date and stays hidden until a date is picked; tickets (GST-008) come after the time; Continue stays off until both are chosen (`performanceReveal`, default `dateTimeTicket`). **Times (REV3-1)** paged with part-of-day chips. **Seated events (REV3-4, REV3-7):** this step before the seat map, or a pop-up on it (`seatEventDateMode`); skipped when the event has one on-sale performance; may render with GST-049 as one step. **Language (REV3-17), experience and level (REV3-19), Booking at (REV3-18), Quick tour (REV3-20).** **Consent questions (REV3-26)** pop up once after the session or date; the *Swim consent pop-up (on/off)* toggle is dropped. Per-guest eligibility is `checkBookingEligibility`, unchanged (DG-3). Guest copy may say *Session* (CFG-10); code keeps `Performance`. Every booking-flow setting named here is read from `getTenantConfig` `bookingFlow`, resolved for the venue the guest picked (audit R267): the tenant's values with that venue's `venueOverrides` entry laid over field by field (decided 29 September, rev 3 CFG-11). **The step order comes from the published booking flow** (W12, 29 September): `getPublishedBookingFlow` returns the flow the product (or its category, else the venue default for its kind) uses, with its enabled steps in `sortOrder`; this screen renders when that flow has its step …

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Booking at** (banner): The venue of this booking with **Change location** (audit R267 choice); a switch clears the selection unless products share a `familyKey`; times and prices refresh. Only when `BookingFlowConfig.locationSwitcher` is on.

**Times** (card list, from `listPerformances`): Compact tiles, `timesPerPage` at a time (8, 12, 24, all; default 24) with Earlier and Later; sold-out times greyed. Hidden until a date is picked (`performanceReveal` `dateTimeTicket`).

The time grid calls it once with `eventId`, `from` and `to` for every performance in the window (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-1), not once per tile.

**What opens over it**

- modal *First booking visit on this device, or Quick tour*: **Four coach marks** over date, time, tickets and basket, with Back, Next and End tour; the first-visit flag is kept on the device only (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-20).

20 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- **Open question.** Is the swim vest an add-on product, and is the splash-and-river pass a separate product offered only to non-swimmers? Default built: the swim answer filters products (as Help me choose); the vest is an add-on; the splash-and-river pass is its own product. *(open · Decisions Register 1 Oct 2026, Questions for the client — Guest safety / Swim ability · DI-1118)*
- The water-park swim answer changes the offer: All of us = full ride list at standard prices; Some of us = ride notes change and a "Swim vests needed" counter appears; None of us = tickets switch to a cheaper splash and river pass, slides removed from ride notes. The swim pop-up is not shown where the question is on the page. *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 4. Swim ability and height gate: the answer changed nothing · DI-1108)*
- Picking a surf session adds nothing to the cart. Then "Tickets for Intermediate surf · 19:30" shows Surfer (session price), Junior surfer 10–15 and Spectator (AED 35); items reach the cart only when a quantity is set. Before a session: "Choose a session above to see its tickets and prices." *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 3. Surfing session added to the cart straight away · DI-1107)*
- The mobile booking flow (date/day-pass selection, quantity, cross-sell, sign-in) is functionally identical to the web app. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1092)*
- Swim ability is a consent question a venue attaches to a product or flow (e.g. "Are you able to swim?", "Do you hold a scuba certification?", "I accept the risk"), each with its own text and per-person or once-per- booking setting. Shown as a pop-up in the venue's theme after session/date; answers recorded. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-26 · Built to match your examples: Swim question (water park) · DI-1062)*
- On a guest's first booking visit, a four-step coach-mark tour highlights date, time, tickets and basket, with Back, Next / Done and End tour; a "Quick tour" button on the booking page replays it. Setting "Quick tour", default off; first-visit flag kept on the device only. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-20 · 20. Enable or disable a Quick Tour that describes the customer journey · DI-1060)*
- Multi-location attractions: the guest picks a location first (e.g. Al Barsha, Mirdif, Yas Island, Sharjah); a "Booking at" bar on later booking steps has Change location. On a switch, times and prices refresh and the selection is cleared unless the products share a family. Setting "Location switcher". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-18 · 18. One tenant with an attraction in several locations; change location · DI-1058)*
- The guest picks a tour language (e.g. English, العربية, Français, Deutsch, 中文, Русский) and only tours in that language are listed. Cinema performances show language and format (2D/3D/subtitled) to pick from. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-17 · 17. Guided tour times based on the tour language · DI-1057)*
- Theatre has its own auditorium seat map: stage (or screen for cinema) at front, Stalls/Circle/Balcony with curved rows, aisles and Premium/Standard/Economy pricing. Date, time, show (plus language & format for cinema) and the seat map sit on one page. Seats per guest booking default 10 (venue setting); basket lists each seat. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-7 · 7. Theatre flow should be similar to the stadium flow · DI-1047)*
- Seated events with one on-sale performance go straight to the seat map (Flow 1). Otherwise date and time come first (Flow 2), either as an inline step (timed-ticket style, default) or as a pop-up dialog over the seat map. Setting "Date & time on seat events". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-4 · 4. Flow 1 (fixed date and time) and Flow 2 (select date, then time, then seat map) · DI-1044)*
- Dated flows reveal in order: date, then time (hidden until a date is picked), then tickets (hidden until a time is picked), with a hint in place telling the guest what to pick next; Continue off until both chosen. Setting "Performance reveal": Date → time → ticket (default) or All at once. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-2 · 2. Step 1 date, step 2 time (only after the date), step 3 ticket · DI-1042)*
- More than eight times show as compact time tiles, paged with Earlier / Later (Times per page 8/12/24/all, default 24), with day-part chips (All, Morning, Afternoon, Evening) showing counts (filter on by default). Day-part boundaries are venue settings, default before 12:00 / 12:00–17:00 / from 17:00. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-1 · 1. Many performances should resize and page; filter by morning, afternoon, evening · DI-1041)*
- On leaving selection (rides, water slides, kids club), each person declares an age band and height band; toggles only where needed (confident swimmer; guardian signature for 12–15). Per-person "Can't take part: too short, needs an adult" with Remove this guest / Choose another activity; Continue locked until all qualify. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, 3. Height and age check (WEB-006) · DI-1037)*
- Guided tours/sessions confirmed: date, then language, then time slot. Sessions come from configuration; the slot grid reflows when there are many slots. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W11 Guided tours / sessions · DI-1013)*
- Museum workshops: after Help me choose, the guest selects the workshop first, then date/time; only relevant products are shown. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W8 Workshops (museum) · DI-1010)*
- Surf sessions follow the time-selection pattern: products (beginner, intermediate...) appear only after a time slot is chosen. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W5 Surf sessions · DI-1007)*
- Guest date picking shows a strip of the next seven days (venue setting dateStripDays, default 7, range 3-31) with a calendar icon that opens the full month for later dates. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, M17-08 · DI-920)*
- Date-change flow detects conflicts across an existing multi-ticket cart and lets the guest shift the whole booking to a new date in one action. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.13 UX Reference Walkthrough (Little Explorer) · DI-587)*
- Allam's UX benchmark (Little Explorer, Dubai): multi-location selector, a horizontal near-term date picker with full-calendar fallback, and tabbed browsing (passes / workshops / packages) on one page rather than multiple screens. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.13 UX Reference Walkthrough (Little Explorer) · DI-585)*
- Start/stop-sell per channel: e.g. a distant desert safari allows no same-day online booking (next day minimum), while onsite stays open to sell-out or a cutoff (e.g. 15 minutes before a timed show). Guest date/time pickers must reflect the channel's window. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.11 Sales schedule & validity · DI-583)*
- Weekday/calendar rules give different validity and pricing to weekday-only vs. all-days products (e.g. Global Village). Blockout dates exclude some ticket types (e.g. memberships) on public holidays/special days, requiring a separate ticket for those dates. *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.5 Validity Management & Expiry Rules · DI-452)*
- Camping/lesson-based tickets: when buying a multi-lesson package (e.g. ski or snowboard lessons on a regular schedule) the guest selects the specific class dates/performances. *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.3 Ticket Type Deep-Dive · DI-449)*
- Time-slot (performance) tickets configure early/late entry and an entry window (e.g. from 30 minutes before start until a cut-off). Multi-day tickets are consecutive-day or flexible within a range (e.g. any 3 days within a month). *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.3 Ticket Type Deep-Dive · DI-447)*
- Kidiya family-pass example showed a dynamic-pricing calendar applied at ticket-type level (prices shown on the calendar per date). *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review — Six Flags Kidiya Reference Walkthrough · DI-430)*
- Platinum List reference: event page with short video + image + description → select tickets → calendar collapsed to a week view, expandable to full month → time-slot selection. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.1 Reference Walkthrough — Platinum List Seat Selection & Checkout Journey · DI-408)*
- Purchase flow: categories (Attractions, Exhibitions, Events, Dining, Shops, Experiences) → ticket selection (from back-office config) → date/time slot → add-ons (per ticket type or generic) → review & pay → confirmation. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-197)*
- Some clients (e.g. museums with 5-6 standard configurations) start by asking the number of guests, which narrows the calendar to dates/times with sufficient availability. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-117)*
- Seat assignment flow is "select time, then select seat", with the two steps on different screens. *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-057)*

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

| Opens with | `productId` (GST-004), `performanceId` (GST-007), `cartId` (session), `venueId` (session) · cold entry: **A link to a product no longer on sale** says so and offers the listing; a performance that has passed offers the next one. |
| Route | `/general/tickets-and-add-ons` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** **Ticket selection moved onto this screen** (GAP-D3): the name promised choosing tickets and add-ons and the definition was a ticket transfer, which stays on GST-014 / GST-045 (one implementation with two ids). Tickets come after the date and time (REV3-2); categories (REV3-16); info-only products show their label and open details (REV3-14); ticket-type descriptions (23SEP-6) and tags (23SEP-3); Help me choose as a region and a sheet (REV3-11); Booking at (REV3-18). On mobile the basket stays a bottom bar with the running total (REV3-10). Every booking-flow setting named here is read from `getTenantConfig` `bookingFlow`, resolved for the venue the guest picked (audit R267): the tenant's values with that venue's `venueOverrides` entry laid over field by field (decided 29 September, rev 3 CFG-11). **The step order comes from the published booking flow** (W12, 29 September): `getPublishedBookingFlow` returns the flow the product (or its category, else the venue default for its kind) uses, with its enabled steps in `sortOrder`; this screen renders when that flow has its step and in the order the flow gives. Flow-level settings (`performanceReveal`, `signInAt`, `seatEventDateMode`, `extrasStep`, `quickTour`, `consentQuestionIds`) are read from the flow; venue-wide settings stay on `getTenantConfig` `bookingFlow`. **29 September.** **W4:** Help me choose filters the products (`guidedAnswerIds`) with *Show everything*; `behaviour` `recommend` stays an option. **W8:** in a product-first flow (workshop, experience) this step comes first and the …

#### Requirements it meets

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- **Open question.** Is the swim vest an add-on product, and is the splash-and-river pass a separate product offered only to non-swimmers? Default built: the swim answer filters products (as Help me choose); the vest is an add-on; the splash-and-river pass is its own product. *(open · Decisions Register 1 Oct 2026, Questions for the client — Guest safety / Swim ability · DI-1118)*
- The water-park swim answer changes the offer: All of us = full ride list at standard prices; Some of us = ride notes change and a "Swim vests needed" counter appears; None of us = tickets switch to a cheaper splash and river pass, slides removed from ride notes. The swim pop-up is not shown where the question is on the page. *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 4. Swim ability and height gate: the answer changed nothing · DI-1108)*
- Picking a surf session adds nothing to the cart. Then "Tickets for Intermediate surf · 19:30" shows Surfer (session price), Junior surfer 10–15 and Spectator (AED 35); items reach the cart only when a quantity is set. Before a session: "Choose a session above to see its tickets and prices." *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 3. Surfing session added to the cart straight away · DI-1107)*
- Guest counters take their price from the chosen park ticket and produce one line, e.g. "2 park ticket · Adult × 3 = AED 1,425" (no separate Adult × 3 line). Child and senior prices scale from the chosen ticket; infants free. *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 2. Multi-park ticket adds an extra adult line · DI-1106)*
- The mobile booking flow (date/day-pass selection, quantity, cross-sell, sign-in) is functionally identical to the web app. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1092)*
- Duplicate screens become one implementation covering several screen IDs (mobile Transfer + Delivery & Sharing; web Wishlist / Devices & Consent; Help Centre + Help & Accessibility as one Help view with FAQ, cases, policies, accessibility tabs). Ticket-selection functions belong on GST-008. Web gets a Group Booking view. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-D3 · D. Duplicate screens merged; group booking on web · DI-1078)*
- Multi-location attractions: the guest picks a location first (e.g. Al Barsha, Mirdif, Yas Island, Sharjah); a "Booking at" bar on later booking steps has Change location. On a switch, times and prices refresh and the selection is cleared unless the products share a family. Setting "Location switcher". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-18 · 18. One tenant with an attraction in several locations; change location · DI-1058)*
- Dated flows reveal in order: date, then time (hidden until a date is picked), then tickets (hidden until a time is picked), with a hint in place telling the guest what to pick next; Continue off until both chosen. Setting "Performance reveal": Date → time → ticket (default) or All at once. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-2 · 2. Step 1 date, step 2 time (only after the date), step 3 ticket · DI-1042)*
- Each Adult / Child / Senior / Infant row has an (i) button showing who the ticket is for and what it includes (up to 300 characters). Setting "Extra info on cards", default on. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 6. Extra information for each ticket in the ticket section · DI-1028)*
- Clicking a ticket opens the Adult / Child / Senior / Infant counters in a side panel on the same listing or details screen (no separate "Select Tickets" step); the panel is open by default on the listing and Book goes straight into the booking. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 5. Clicking Dated Day Pass should show the tickets on the same screen · DI-1027)*
- Ticket cards, Read more and the listing side panel show tags (e.g. "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Free adult entry", "Valid 90 days", "Emirates ID"), each with a kind icon (clock, height, free, calendar, id), max 6. Venue-set tags win, else derived from duration, validity, height rule. Setting "Tags on tickets", default on. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 3. 'Read more' should carry tags customisable per ticket type · DI-1025)*
- Museum workshops: after Help me choose, the guest selects the workshop first, then date/time; only relevant products are shown. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W8 Workshops (museum) · DI-1010)*
- Surf sessions follow the time-selection pattern: products (beginner, intermediate...) appear only after a time slot is chosen. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W5 Surf sessions · DI-1007)*
- "Help me choose" (experience builder) is not a consent step: its questions (yes/no, age, certified or not, etc.) filter the catalogue so only suitable products are shown (Deep Dive Dubai reference). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W4 Help me choose · DI-1005)*
- Add-ons appear only on the Add-ons / Extras step, never in the ticket panels. Each add-on appears once (no duplicates such as 'Large locker' on two steps). *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Cart 11. Show add-ons only on the Add-ons / Extras page · DI-979)*
- **Open question.** Cabanas: category (premium, VIP, luxury, private, family, couples), date/time, guest count, amenity details. Activities: desert-safari packages (buy-one-get-one, evening, Bedouin-style), pickup point, add-ons (stroller), duration packages (2-hour/4-hour). *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Cabanas, Activities) · DI-687)*
- Reference details: sibling/multi-buy discount shown with a struck-through original price; workshop add-ons inline with theme/cuisine sub-selection feeding time-slot availability; a package builder for bundled experiences. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.13 UX Reference Walkthrough (Little Explorer) · DI-586)*
- Decision (Qossai, Ski Dubai): instructor choice is a per-ticket-type setting — private-session products may let the guest pick a specific instructor; group-session products auto-assign without showing a choice. Private and group are separate, separately priced products (a private request on a group instructor is its own product). *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-504)*
- Quantity/purchase limits can be set per order, per guest, per account category and per sales channel (e.g. maximum 6 tickets per transaction). *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.8 Eligibility Rules, Special Products & Memberships · DI-464)*
- Decision: the add-ons step is optional/removable in configuration for products with no add-ons, collapsing the flow to Ticket Selection → Cart → Checkout. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review; 5. Key Decisions · DI-428)*
- Decision: ticket types are browsed in-page, not across multiple pages; "View all ticket types" expands additional categories in place. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review; 5. Key Decisions · DI-427)*
- Product cards/pages carry short descriptions with an expandable "view more details" control and a configurable hero image or video per product. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review — Six Flags Kidiya Reference Walkthrough · DI-425)*
- Purchase flow: categories (Attractions, Exhibitions, Events, Dining, Shops, Experiences) → ticket selection (from back-office config) → date/time slot → add-ons (per ticket type or generic) → review & pay → confirmation. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-197)*
- Minimum/maximum sellable quantity per customer (e.g. a promotional bundle requiring at least two) must be enforced at selection. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 16. Entitlement Components: Re-entry, Expiration & Sale Restrictions · DI-172)*
- Some clients (e.g. museums with 5-6 standard configurations) start by asking the number of guests, which narrows the calendar to dates/times with sufficient availability. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-117)*

Also apply: 8 for P02 · Booking & Selection, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Booking settings (tenant, with per-venue overrides)*, set in `CMS-016` Site Settings:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- The mobile booking flow (date/day-pass selection, quantity, cross-sell, sign-in) is functionally identical to the web app. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1092)*
- "Upgrade your day" (upgrades) stays hidden until a main ticket is in the cart. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Cart 10. Show upgrades only after the main ticket is in the cart · DI-978)*
- A guest is not repeatedly re-offered something already declined (e.g. a fast pass rejected three times), and an offer ignored online is not re-presented on another channel, e.g. at POS after the guest bought it there. *(agreed · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.6 Personalized Offer Delivery & Omni-Channel Orchestration · DI-962)*
- What a guest is offered depends on context: a member is not offered another membership (F&B or retail add-ons instead); general admission is not offered once VIP/fast pass is selected; an expiring membership prompts a renewal rather than a new product; similar offers are not shown back-to-back (alternate F&B and experience upsells). *(client request · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.2 / 4.3 / 4.5 Recommendation Strategy and Decisioning · DI-960)*
- Recommendations stay within business limits, e.g. at most three recommendations shown at checkout and never a product the customer already owns; AI recommendations never override hard business rules or eligibility constraints. *(agreed · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.3 Recommendation Strategy — Business Priority, Conflict Suppression & Fallback · DI-959)*
- Upsell/cross-sell offers (e.g. a family pass after 2 adult + 2 child tickets are added) are a distinct "extras" step after main product selection, not inline on the ticket selection page, where guests would miss them. *(agreed · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-951)*
- Add-ons attached to a main product can be mandatory or optional; cross-sell offers related add-on products, upsell proposes a higher tier (e.g. adult admission → membership). *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.9 Bundles, Add-Ons, Donations & Policies · DI-470)*
- Decision: the add-ons step is optional/removable in configuration for products with no add-ons, collapsing the flow to Ticket Selection → Cart → Checkout. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review; 5. Key Decisions · DI-428)*

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (19), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (403, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (9 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-048?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Add cart line.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-001`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 9 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `GST-049` Interactive Seat Selection

**See interactive seat selection for this venue.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Booking & Selection · wave 2 · needs the `seating` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #18131 (APP-MOB-GST-049) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | statusTracker (comfortable density): `getSeatAvailability` reads one record and nothing reads a population — the screen is about that one thing |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Opens with | `performanceId` (deepLink), `eventId` (GST-007), `holdId` (navigation) · cold entry: **A link to a performance that has happened.** Offers the next performance of the same event. |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. **Drawn 26 August** — `Seat Board 4.dc.html` frame `seat-4a`. **The frame names this screen on its own face**, which is the first pack to do that: the earlier F&B, POS and Retail boards had to be hand-assigned by purpose after three derivation attempts produced nonsense. **A board that says what it draws removes the guess entirely.** **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Date and time inline or as a pop-up (REV3-4); view box always below on mobile (REV3-5, 23SEP-14); time bar (REV3-6); at most `VenueSettings.seating.maxSeatsPerGuestOrder` seats per booking (default 10, bounds 1-50; `422 seat-limit-exceeded` reads *Up to {maxSeats} seats per booking*) and the basket lists each seat (REV3-7); may render with GST-007 as one step (REV3-7); fixture strip and a direct path from GST-004 (23SEP-16). A cabana map is GST-074, not this screen (REV3-15). Every booking-flow setting named here is read from `getTenantConfig` `bookingFlow`, resolved for the venue the guest picked (audit R267): the tenant's values with that venue's `venueOverrides` entry laid over field by field (decided 29 September, rev 3 CFG-11). **29 September (W2).** Sections first, zoom into a section for seats, pinch out or *Whole map* back to the full map; held seats are kept.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- The mobile stadium/venue seat map uses the same pinch-to-zoom-in and zoom-out interaction agreed on the web; seat rendering was glitched in this build but the behaviour is confirmed as intended. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1095)*
- Theatre has its own auditorium seat map: stage (or screen for cinema) at front, Stalls/Circle/Balcony with curved rows, aisles and Premium/Standard/Economy pricing. Date, time, show (plus language & format for cinema) and the seat map sit on one page. Seats per guest booking default 10 (venue setting); basket lists each seat. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-7 · 7. Theatre flow should be similar to the stadium flow · DI-1047)*
- A time bar above the seat map shows the chosen performance, lets the guest switch show and has Change date; switching releases held seats. Setting "Time bar above seat map", default on. On the selection step, time sits directly under the date, above language & format and tickets. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-6 · 6. Time selection on top, configurable · DI-1046)*
- The 'view from your seat' box can sit Bottom (default), Right, Left or Top of the seat map (web only); on narrow screens and mobile it is always below the map. Setting "Seat view box". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-5 · 5. CMS option to show the seat view right, left, top or bottom · DI-1045)*
- Seated events with one on-sale performance go straight to the seat map (Flow 1). Otherwise date and time come first (Flow 2), either as an inline step (timed-ticket style, default) or as a pop-up dialog over the seat map. Setting "Date & time on seat events". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-4 · 4. Flow 1 (fixed date and time) and Flow 2 (select date, then time, then seat map) · DI-1044)*
- Picking a section shows the view from that section (concert mode shows the stage; closer sections see a larger stage with fewer rows in front). Use the venue's photo for the section when supplied, otherwise render the view from the imported 3D geometry. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Seat map 14. Show the view to the stage in the small window · DI-1030)*
- Stadium/theatre seat maps show sections first with colour and price; zooming into a section shows its seats. Pinch-out / scroll-out returns to the full map so other sections can be compared. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W2 Seat maps · DI-1003)*
- Zoomed in, every nearby section shows its seats as equal-size dots: available in the section's price colour, taken in grey, picked seat highlighted. Zoom in, Zoom out and "Whole map" buttons sit under the map. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Seat map 17. When zoomed in, show the available seats across the map · DI-983)*
- Each picked seat goes into the cart with section, row, seat and price (e.g. "Section 101 · Row A, Seat 4 · AED 165"); tapping the seat again removes it. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Seat map 15. Selected seats should be added to the cart · DI-982)*
- On 3D venue maps, selecting a section takes the guest straight into that section's seats in one motion by zooming in, not via a separate pop-up, modal or new window. *(agreed · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.13 Guest Website UX Review — Ticket Type Flows & Seat Map Selection · DI-950)*
- 3D seat view: a guest booking a seated event (e.g. stadium concert) can preview the view from the selected section in 3D - built in (Three.js in React), no third-party integration; the standard 2D seat map remains the simpler option. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.2 Guest Web App - 3D Stadium Seat View & At-Venue Wayfinding · DI-889)*
- **Open question.** Prototype events: concert seat-map selection modelled on Coca-Cola Arena (like Platinum List); multi-day festival with day/time-slot selection; tiered show tickets (early bird, couple, group-of-4, group-of-6); all share one add-to-cart and checkout flow. *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Events) · DI-685)*
- Decision: seats held in a cart auto-release after a configurable timeout if checkout is abandoned, and immediately if a payment attempt fails. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.6 Seat Inventory Status; 5. Key Decisions · DI-422)*
- Decision: seating rules — consecutive-seat enforcement (no single empty seat left between bookings), social-distancing buffer (auto-block adjacent seats), seat-kill rule, company/held-seat rule — are configurable per venue/event, defaulting to the venue's operational policy. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.3 Best-Seat Logic, Seating Rules; 5. Key Decisions · DI-416)*
- One seat map can mix section types — e.g. 8 of 10 sections seated and 2 standing ("fan pit" near the stage); suites sell either as a private bulk-priced suite or as individual seats within the suite. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.2 Seat Map Builder — Section Types · DI-411)*
- Decision: three seat-selection models, selectable per section, per event: (1) zone/capacity selling with no seat numbers (guest told zone only); (2) system-assigned "best available" — guest picks section + quantity, seats disclosed later; (3) full customer seat selection. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.1 Reference Walkthrough; 4.2 Seat Map Builder; 5. Key Decisions · DI-410)*
- Platinum List reference seat step: interactive seat map colour-coded by price tier → seat selection with a live cart hold and countdown timer → checkout via Quick Order / Apple ID / Google ID. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.1 Reference Walkthrough — Platinum List Seat Selection & Checkout Journey · DI-409)*
- Drag-and-drop page builder with a standardised layout (header, footer, hero/card components) that adapts to product type — seat map for seated products, standard flow for general admission. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-394)*
- Movie/cinema ticketing is in scope through the seat management module (e.g. a Kuwait museum's educational cinema: assigned seats, a film, a time slot). *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 5. Movie Ticketing · DI-286)*
- Booking steps follow the product type: admission goes straight to quantity; dated products to a date, timed ones on to a time, then quantity; seated products to zone, then seats on a seat map, then quantity by variant (adult, child, concession). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-131)*
- Seat assignment flow is "select time, then select seat", with the two steps on different screens. *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-057)*

Also apply: 8 for P02 · Booking & Selection, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Booking settings (tenant, with per-venue overrides)*, set in `CMS-016` Site Settings:

### `GST-050` Resource Booking – Cabana

**Book a cabana or other capacity-based resource.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Booking & Selection · wave 3 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #18211 (APP-MOB-GST-050) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `listProducts` reads the population and `getAvailability` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Opens with | `cartId` (session) · cold entry: Resolves from the session; a cold arrival is the ordinary case. |

**What the spec says about it.** Minuted 10 Aug §4.8: *"resource bookings (e.g., cabana rental) decrement a capacity-based inventory on booking"*. **Distinct from GST-058**: this is one resource with a price and a booking action; GST-058 is availability across areas. Confirmed against storyboard boards 7.10 and 8.8 on 18 August. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** **A cabana placed on an ingested venue map is picked on the map and bought** (REV3-15 and GAP-C2, superseding audit R073 (c) for those resources): that is GST-074. This screen stays for a resource sold as capacity where the venue has no map, so the unit is assigned rather than chosen. **29 September (W6).** Map booking of cabanas stays **optional per flow**: the venue picks *Cabana: pick on map* (GST-074) or *Cabana: by size* (GST-050 / GST-058) as its booking flow (CMS-103), and the resource selection policy (`guestMayChoose`, REV3-15) decides whether the guest chooses the unit. Same venue-map back end as F&B and locations.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Cabanas** (card list, from `listProducts`): The venue's cabanas and other bookable spaces. The venue is the one the guest picked on Home (`venueId` from the session, audit R267), never typed. Was the generated table 'Every product'; staff and plumbing columns removed (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-3)).

The time grid calls it once with `eventId`, `from` and `to` for every performance in the window (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-1), not once per tile.

#### Requirements it meets

21 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- The table/cabana screen becomes map-based booking: a venue map can carry cabanas, loungers, tables (beach or event tables) and other bookable resources, sold like cabanas. Dining tables stay F&B table reservations. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-C2 · C. Wave 2: Reserve a Table or Cabana (waitlist, notify) · DI-1076)*
- Cabanas are picked on the venue's ingested map, like stadium seats: numbered cabanas by zone (e.g. R01–R10, T01–T08, S01–S06, B01–B10) showing guests seated, sold-out greyed and marked. Tapping one adds it (e.g. "Cabana B09 · Large cabana · Beach, AED 1,855") and starts a remaining-time counter. Map on the first screen. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-15 · 15. Book the product from the map (e.g. pick an available cabana) · DI-1055)*
- Map-based cabana booking stays optional per configuration, since not every operator uses the same flow; it uses the same map back end as theme-park F&B/locations (reusable later for in-park navigation). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W6 Cabanas · DI-1008)*
- **Open question.** Cabanas: category (premium, VIP, luxury, private, family, couples), date/time, guest count, amenity details. Activities: desert-safari packages (buy-one-get-one, evening, Bedouin-style), pickup point, add-ons (stroller), duration packages (2-hour/4-hour). *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Cabanas, Activities) · DI-687)*

Also apply: 8 for P02 · Booking & Selection, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. **29 September (MOB-4).** A **meal combo with admission** is a bundle with an admission component and a meal component: *Buy meal combo* on Item Detail (GST-004) opens it here, and checkout is about three steps.

**Known gaps.** The screen opens on one bundle (`bundleId` from Item Detail); the list of every bundle was the generator's.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Form: Add to cart** (modal, opened by *Add to cart*; *Add cart line* calls `addCartLine`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**The choices the bundle asks for, and how many.** `addCartLine` with the bundle's variant.

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Reference details: sibling/multi-buy discount shown with a struck-through original price; workshop add-ons inline with theme/cuisine sub-selection feeding time-slot availability; a package builder for bundled experiences. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.13 UX Reference Walkthrough (Little Explorer) · DI-586)*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

### `GST-058` Resource Availability (Cabana)

**See which cabanas are free, by area and date, before choosing one.**

| Route | `/general/resource-availability-cabana` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Deliberately separate from GST-050**, and checked on 18 August. Board 8 panel 8 is availability across areas with counts remaining; board 7 panel 10 is one cabana with a price and a Book Now. **A list and a detail, not a duplicate** — merging them would put a booking action on a browsing screen. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Where the venue's spots are on an ingested map, availability is shown on the map (GST-074, REV3-15); this list stays for capacity-sold resources. **29 September (W6).** Map booking of cabanas stays **optional per flow**: the venue picks *Cabana: pick on map* (GST-074) or *Cabana: by size* (GST-050 / GST-058) as its booking flow (CMS-103), and the resource selection policy (`guestMayChoose`, REV3-15) decides whether the guest chooses the unit. Same venue-map back end as F&B and locations.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- The table/cabana screen becomes map-based booking: a venue map can carry cabanas, loungers, tables (beach or event tables) and other bookable resources, sold like cabanas. Dining tables stay F&B table reservations. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-C2 · C. Wave 2: Reserve a Table or Cabana (waitlist, notify) · DI-1076)*
- Cabanas are picked on the venue's ingested map, like stadium seats: numbered cabanas by zone (e.g. R01–R10, T01–T08, S01–S06, B01–B10) showing guests seated, sold-out greyed and marked. Tapping one adds it (e.g. "Cabana B09 · Large cabana · Beach, AED 1,855") and starts a remaining-time counter. Map on the first screen. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-15 · 15. Book the product from the map (e.g. pick an available cabana) · DI-1055)*
- Map-based cabana booking stays optional per configuration, since not every operator uses the same flow; it uses the same map back end as theme-park F&B/locations (reusable later for in-park navigation). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W6 Cabanas · DI-1008)*
- **Open question.** Cabanas: category (premium, VIP, luxury, private, family, couples), date/time, guest count, amenity details. Activities: desert-safari packages (buy-one-get-one, evening, Bedouin-style), pickup point, add-ons (stroller), duration packages (2-hour/4-hour). *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Cabanas, Activities) · DI-687)*

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

### `GST-072` Share & Group Booking

**What the spec says about it.** **A guest buying eight tickets could not give seven of them away.** `shareEntitlement`, `getGroupBooking` and `respondToInvitation` had no surface, so a group booking was one person holding eight barcodes. **`createReferral` writes `marketing.referral`, which nothing reads** — one of the sixteen orphan writes. This screen is where the reward would be visible, and it stays an open question until the wallet session settles what a referral credit is.

**Known gaps.** Referrals are not this screen's job, and the referral write has no reader yet. Challenges are not this screen's job.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- **Open question.** Are water-park groups booked into a session (the build picks a session first)? Default built: group requests take a date and, for session-based products, a session. *(open · Decisions Register 1 Oct 2026, Questions for the client — Group booking / Water-park groups by session · DI-1117)*
- **Open question.** Each group ticket card shows a minimum group size; is it set per group ticket, and what values? Default built: each group ticket carries its own minimum, default 10. *(open · Decisions Register 1 Oct 2026, Questions for the client — Group booking / Minimum group size · DI-1116)*
- **Open question.** Do Tour operator and Community become their own group types or map to general? Default built: School, Corporate, Tour operator and Community shown as their own group types (platform also has general and party). *(open · Decisions Register 1 Oct 2026, Questions for the client — Group booking / Group types · DI-1115)*
- **Open question.** How many supervisors come free per group (per N guests), and is it per group ticket? Default built: supervisors are a separate, free guest type, up to 1 per 10 guests, counted on the group request. *(open · Decisions Register 1 Oct 2026, Questions for the client — Group booking / Supervisors · DI-1114)*
- Supervisors are listed separately and are free; the enquiry panel shows the estimate as e.g. "School group · Guests × 45". Water park group booking: pick a session, then enter the number of swimmers and supervisors. On mobile the headcount stepper has a +10 button. *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 1. Group booking: product missing, enter the number of people · DI-1105)*
- Group / school booking starts with group ticket cards (School, Corporate, Tour operator, Community), each showing a per-person price and minimum group size. Then "How many people" is a number box the guest can type (e.g. 45) or step with − / +; no Group size dropdown. *(client request · design review 30 Sep 2026, 1. Group booking: product missing, enter the number of people · DI-1104)*
- Duplicate screens become one implementation covering several screen IDs (mobile Transfer + Delivery & Sharing; web Wishlist / Devices & Consent; Help Centre + Help & Accessibility as one Help view with FAQ, cases, policies, accessibility tabs). Ticket-selection functions belong on GST-008. Web gets a Group Booking view. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-D3 · D. Duplicate screens merged; group booking on web · DI-1078)*
- Group bookings: one shared QR for the whole group (redeemed together at the counter) or one QR per person, each of which the guest can link to their own profile in the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 6. Food & Beverage — Ordering, Delivery, and Redemption · DI-289)*

Also apply: 8 for P02 · Booking & Selection, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

### `GST-074` Map Booking — Cabanas & Spots

**Pick a specific cabana, lounger or other spot on the venue map and hold it while you book.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Booking & Selection · wave 3 · needs the `resources` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #20735 (APP-MOB-GST-074) |

| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `getMapResourceAvailability` reads the population of spots and a tap holds one of them — list (as a map), select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** The map and the spots already loaded stay on screen with their age, never shown as free now. Holding a spot and adding it to the basket need the connection — a cabana held offline is a cabana two people think they have. |
| Opens with | `mapId` (GST-004), `productId` (GST-004), `cartId` (session), `venueId` (session), `holdId` (navigation) · cold entry: **A link to a map that is no longer published, or a day that has passed,** says which and offers today on the current map. Nothing is held on arrival. |
| Route | `/general/map-booking` |

**What the spec says about it.** **New 29 September** (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-15 and GAP-C2). **Cabana maps work like the stadium seat map:** the venue's map is ingested with its cabanas, loungers and other bookable spots (number, zone, capacity, price band), and the guest picks a specific one on the map and buys it. This supersedes audit R073 (c) (*cabanas stay staff-booked*) for resources placed on an ingested map. **Tables on the map are non-dining spots sold like cabanas** (decided 29 September by the user); a restaurant table stays the F&B reservation flow (WEB-036 / GST-070). The map comes from `getVenueMap` (its `resources`: label, kind, zone, capacity, price band, boundary) and the status of every spot for the chosen day from one `getMapResourceAvailability` call, joined on `resourceId`; held, booked and unavailable spots are greyed. Tapping a free spot calls `createResourceHold` and starts the *Remaining time* counter from the hold's `expiresAt` (8 minutes, extendable to 30 in all, audit R169); Add to basket sends `addCartLine` with the spot's price-band `variantId` and the `resourceHoldId`, e.g. *Cabana B09 · Large cabana · Beach, AED 1,855*. Picking another spot releases the first hold (`relinquishResourceHold`). **29 September (W6).** Map booking of cabanas stays **optional per flow**: the venue picks *Cabana: pick on map* (GST-074) or *Cabana: by size* (GST-050 / GST-058) as its booking flow (CMS-103), and the resource selection policy (`guestMayChoose`, REV3-15) decides whether the guest chooses the unit. Same venue-map back end as F&B and locations.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- The table/cabana screen becomes map-based booking: a venue map can carry cabanas, loungers, tables (beach or event tables) and other bookable resources, sold like cabanas. Dining tables stay F&B table reservations. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-C2 · C. Wave 2: Reserve a Table or Cabana (waitlist, notify) · DI-1076)*
- Cabanas are picked on the venue's ingested map, like stadium seats: numbered cabanas by zone (e.g. R01–R10, T01–T08, S01–S06, B01–B10) showing guests seated, sold-out greyed and marked. Tapping one adds it (e.g. "Cabana B09 · Large cabana · Beach, AED 1,855") and starts a remaining-time counter. Map on the first screen. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-15 · 15. Book the product from the map (e.g. pick an available cabana) · DI-1055)*
- Map-based cabana booking stays optional per configuration, since not every operator uses the same flow; it uses the same map back end as theme-park F&B/locations (reusable later for in-park navigation). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W6 Cabanas · DI-1008)*
- **Open question.** Cabanas: category (premium, VIP, luxury, private, family, couples), date/time, guest count, amenity details. Activities: desert-safari packages (buy-one-get-one, evening, Bedouin-style), pickup point, add-ons (stroller), duration packages (2-hour/4-hour). *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Cabanas, Activities) · DI-687)*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

- Flow F52 *A guest books a cabana and uses it*, step 1: They open the venue map for the day and see which cabanas are free. → **Every spot in one call**, joined to the map on `resourceId`: number, zone, capacity, price band, and held, booked or unavailable ones greyed.
- Flow F52 *A guest books a cabana and uses it*, step 2: They tap a cabana, hold it and add it to the basket. → **The guest chooses the unit** and it is held (`ResourceHold`, a remaining-time counter from `expiresAt`) until the order converts the hold into a booking, so nobody takes it in between.
- Flow F52 branch at step 2 (medium): when Someone else holds or books the tapped cabana first, or everything in the area is taken., **`409` names the cabana and the clash**; the map refreshes and offers another cabana, another area or another day, not an empty list (rev 3 REV3-15).

### `GST-075` Book a Space by the Hour

**Book a meeting room or other space for a start time and a length; the price is the room rate for that length.**

**What the spec says about it.** **New 29 September** (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-13: meeting rooms by the hour are in scope). A staged booking: date → start time → length (1 hour, 2 hours, half day, full day) → room type (focus pod, majlis, boardroom, auditorium) → attendees → add-ons (coffee break, working lunch, AV technician). **A room type is a product with `requiresTimeWindow`; a length is one of its variants** (the `length` axis, each value with `durationMinutes`), priced on its own, so the price is the variant's — the room rate for that length. The guest never names a room: `addCartLine` carries `bookedWindow` {startsAt, endsAt}, `endsAt` being the start plus the length, and `allocateResources` picks the room at checkout (26 August minute). Add-ons are lines with `parentLineId`. `422 windowLengthMismatch`, `windowRequired` and `windowNotAllowed` are programming errors; `409 windowUnavailable` says the time filled and offers the next free start. **29 September (W9).** Availability is checked against date, start time and length together (`listProductStartTimes` with `variantId` = length); changing any of the three re-checks every room, and a busy room shows *free from*. Starts every 15 minutes where the venue sets `stepMinutes` 15.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Meeting rooms by the hour are in scope: date → start time → length (1 hour, 2 hours, half day, full day) → room (focus pod, majlis room, boardroom, auditorium) → attendees → add-ons (coffee break, working lunch, AV technician). Price = room rate × length; the cart line shows the booked time window. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-13 · 13. House of Wisdom: meeting room flow · DI-1053)*
- Cleaning buffer is configurable. Option A: fixed buffer (e.g. 15 min) after every booking. Option B: N cleanings per day; the system places the buffers into the day's schedule and adjusts availability. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W10 Meeting-room cleaning buffer · DI-1012)*
- Meeting-room availability is checked against date + start time + duration together; changing any of the three re-checks all rooms. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W9 Meeting rooms · DI-1011)*
- **Open question.** Resources: meeting-room booking (headcount, duration, time slot, room, add-ons tea/coffee/snacks), modelled on House of Wisdom. Merchandise: browse, cart with add/remove quantity, pickup or doorstep delivery. F&B: outlet/menu browsing; collect at counter, curbside, doorstep or priority delivery. *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Resources, Merchandise, F&B) · DI-690)*
- UX reference: House of Wisdom (Sharjah library) meeting-room/"pod" booking and tiered membership plans — a simple duration-based booking flow without fixed performances/time slots — to be reviewed by Chinmay/Aishwarya. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 6. Open Items · DI-506)*
- A bookable resource such as a meeting room can be priced per hour: total price is calculated from the booked duration and the room is blocked for that window so no other guest can book it. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A · DI-503)*
- Resources are one-to-one (dedicated to a booking) or shared (e.g. a meeting room with bookable pods, a vehicle across sequential slots); further sales are blocked once a shared resource's capacity/slot is full and reopened if a booking is cancelled. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.7 Dynamic Resource Assignment for Experience Tickets · DI-496)*

Also apply: 8 for P02 · Booking & Selection, 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (23), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (40 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#GST-075?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Add to basket.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `GST-041`, `GST-004`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 7 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Never configurable:** The *Powered by TICVAI* credit in the footer is fixed and never client-editable (MoM 3 Aug, DI-111; MoM 12 Aug, DI-250). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P02 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Mobile App v4.dc.html`: Mobile App v4, the newest guest look (29 September, with the 30 September feedback in the booking flows). It replaces the 28 September Mobile v2 build.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the booking engine that runs inside the app. Keep both files in the same folder.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P02 Guest App

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Products can be presented in multiple card layout styles: carousel, video poster, split, etc. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1089)*
- The home-screen navigation bar layout is configurable: home/explore/map/buy-tickets in different arrangements. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1087)*
- The revised mobile app design is approved in direction: Qossai liked the opening video and visual polish, Allam the UI/graphics quality. Its flow is deliberately different from the web application (after front-end team input), not a reused structure. Detailed feedback to follow. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.4 Guest Mobile App — Revised Design Walkthrough · DI-1086)*
- Every web product and flow stays bookable in the mobile app (incl. cabanas, surf, 2D/3D stadium, theatre plan, bus route map), each with its own step order; a toggle switches back to one decision per screen. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — All web products and flows available · DI-1084)*
- Mobile app must not open straight into booking (client found it unclear). Tabs: Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references), with a persistent "Buy tickets" button on every screen (raised centre button, or floating / flat per venue). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tabs Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets, persistent Buy tickets · DI-1081)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Optional intro video on opening the app, with a "Skip introduction" control. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1020)*
- A persistent "Buy tickets" button appears on every screen of the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1017)*
- Mobile tabs: Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1016)*
- The current mobile build goes straight into the booking journey and the client finds it unclear: redesign the UI. All web products and flows, including cabanas and surf, must remain available. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1015)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Accreditation is primarily completed in the web portal (document upload and photo checks suit a larger screen); the same submission is also available in the guest mobile app as a secondary option for individuals. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.8 Accreditation Channel Placement & API Access · DI-666)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

### In P02 · Booking & Selection

- A "save and finish later" option retains an in-progress order locally. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1094)*
- Each ticket type gets its own flow: open-dated (no calendar step, straight to guest category/quantity, valid e.g. 30-60 days), dated (date, then product), dated-with-time (date, time, product) and seated (date, time, seat selection). *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.13 Guest Website UX Review — Ticket Type Flows & Seat Map Selection · DI-948)*
- **Open question.** Movies: language/screen type (e.g. English, Dolby Atmos), cinema and showtime, seats, concession add-ons. Theme park: ticket-type list, guest categories (adult/child/senior/infant/people of determination with companion), per-ticket guest-name capture driven by quantity. *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Movies, Theme park) · DI-686)*
- Decision: season-pass/family-type products capture first and last name for each individual pass holder (not just the purchaser), via an "add guest name" step. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review; 5. Key Decisions · DI-429)*
- Decision: the B2C checkout shows a clear, visible step indicator — Ticket Selection → Add-ons → My Cart → Checkout. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review; 5. Key Decisions · DI-426)*
- Reference checkouts: Six Flags-style (product → quantity/name capture → cart summary → login/guest checkout with dual OTP validation) and Platinum List (event → date → colour-coded interactive seat map → seats → one-page checkout via Quick Order/Apple/Google, as few as four clicks, optional post-purchase profile prompt). *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-398)*
- **Open question.** Two selection patterns: (a) event, date, time, see availability, then product; (b) product, quantity, date, then only time slots with enough capacity. How many customization scenarios to support needs deeper UI exploration. *(open · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-118)*
- Navigation depends on ticket type: admission has no date/time and goes straight to quantity/cart; dated asks date only; timed asks date then time; seated asks date, then time, then seat. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-116)*

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
