## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 10 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, GUEST_MANAGE, GUEST_VIEW, MARKETING_MANAGE, PRODUCT_VIEW, ROLE_MANAGE, SCOPE_VIEW, TENANT_CONFIGURE, TENANT_PUBLISH, USER_MANAGE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

## Thin screens in this batch

**CMS-011, CMS-012 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*

- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*

Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred.

- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P13 Venue CMS

- The config side panel is a reference tool only, not the CMS. The CMS will be step-based and include header/footer, logos and banners. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W12 Config side panel · DI-1014)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- Qossai: build AI-assisted site design/generation into the website builder, keeping site design (header, footer, color, font, layout) separate from content (tickets), with tickets flowing into the site's structure once published. To be explored. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 7. AI-Assisted Website Generation · DI-115)*
- Qossai: give clients as much design flexibility as possible within the configurable structure. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-114)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*

### In P13 · White Label

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Qossai (rated the CMS prototype ~70%): a client should be able to build a working site "within 30 minutes", easily adding header, footer, fonts and its own images/graphics self-service; Allam: every CMS option must visibly change something and the interface must be intuitive to navigate. *(client request · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.8 Guest Web App CMS Prototype — Feedback on Maturity & Scope Expectations · DI-988)*
- The reviewed prototype is the actual guest-facing B2C site customers browse and book from, not a CMS tool. A separate, more limited white-label interface lets a client adjust colours, fonts and layout from a menu of options; not yet built in the prototype. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-887)*
- Base structure (header, footer, layout) is fixed across tenants; logo, colour, font and module visibility (e.g. hide Dining or Retail) are configurable per tenant, and independently for web and mobile (e.g. a different mobile header). *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 4. White-Labeling and Customization Boundaries · DI-285)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- Modules enabled/disabled per tenant by licence: Ticketing & Booking, Membership, Events, Attractions, Virtual Queue, F&B, Retail, Parking; add-ons (Lost & Found, AI Concierge Chat, multi-language, integrations) toggle the same way and appear automatically as new integrations are built. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-193)*
- Allam: banner, header, footer and background color are CMS-configurable per client, but site structure and navigation flow are fixed and adapt automatically to product configuration (dated, non-dated, seated, membership products surface the right fields). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-119)*
- A "powered by [platform]" footer credit is fixed and not client-editable. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-111)*
- White-label sites share one platform/template but each is configured independently: header, footer, logo, colors, fonts and hero banner are client-editable from the backend. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-108)*

### Screen by screen

**`CMS-011` Translations**

- A new language is added as a configuration change, not development. Qossai wants a table-driven workflow like his prior project: a translation spreadsheet with a column per language reviewed by native speakers, then fed back through an AI translation pass. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-083)*
- Translation workflow: text entered in English, machine-translated, then reviewed and validated by the tenant's own team in the back office/CMS before publishing; applies to website, POS and mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-081)*

**`CMS-014` Publishing Workflow**

- Each client owns its Apple and Google developer accounts; the app is built in the CMS from a published configuration, with an in-platform guide (D-U-N-S number, opening accounts, store listing, store review). *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, M24-08 · DI-998)*
- The builder flow ends in a Review & Publish step before configuration goes live. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-194)*

**`CMS-016` Site Settings**

- Guest date picking shows a strip of the next seven days (venue setting dateStripDays, default 7, range 3-31) with a calendar icon that opens the full month for later dates. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, M17-08 · DI-920)*
- CMS manages multiple sites/venues: branding, colour palette including custom hex codes, fonts, Google Analytics site IDs, production/staging environments. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-393)*
- One client can run multiple branded sites from the same setup, e.g. two brands sharing a footer but with distinct headers and hero banners. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-110)*

**`CMS-017` Domain & Certificate**

- Guest web hosting: small tenants run under a subdomain/subpath of the TICVAI domain; larger clients get a dedicated URL on their own domain. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-283)*

**`CMS-018` Consent & Legal**

- Refund policy shown to guests is tiered and driven by back-office rules per business, e.g. no refund <24h, 50% between 24–48h, 100% >48h. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-192)*
- Configurable FAQ section plus Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy with an accept/deny prompt. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-191)*

**`CMS-101` Help Me Choose**

- Help me choose needs a configuration page per venue; AI may propose the question set from the product catalogue for the operator to validate and edit. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W4 Help me choose · DI-1006)*
- "Help me choose" (experience builder) is not a consent step: its questions (yes/no, age, certified or not, etc.) filter the catalogue so only suitable products are shown (Deep Dive Dubai reference). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W4 Help me choose · DI-1005)*
- Help me choose setup per venue: up to 2 questions, 3 answers each (title, one-line description, icon, optional badge e.g. "Best value"), each answer mapped to one booking flow, a result card (title, description, image) per recommendable product, and placement (button above products, pop-up on arrival, off). *(agreed · design review 23 Sep 2026, What the venue sets up in the CMS (per venue) · DI-984)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
