## Who this is for

**guest on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `LEDGER_VIEW, ORDER_CANCEL, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **3 of these operations work offline**: listFxRates, listOrders, listProducts
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.

## The screens

| id | name | pattern | ops | overlays | machine |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GST-014` | Ticket Transfer | listDetail | 3 | 2 | — |
| `GST-016` | My Reservations | listDetail | 3 | 1 | — |
| `GST-017` | Reservation Details | statusTracker | 2 | 1 | — |
| `GST-044` | Multi-Currency & Pricing | listDetail | 2 | 0 | — |

## Thin screens in this batch

**GST-017 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P02 Guest App

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Products can be presented in multiple card layout styles: carousel, video poster, split, etc. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1089)*
- The home-screen navigation bar layout is configurable: home/explore/map/buy-tickets in different arrangements. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1087)*
- The revised mobile app design is approved in direction: Qossai liked the opening video and visual polish, Allam the UI/graphics quality. Its flow is deliberately different from the web application (after front-end team input), not a reused structure. Detailed feedback to follow. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.4 Guest Mobile App — Revised Design Walkthrough · DI-1086)*
- Every web product and flow stays bookable in the mobile app (incl. cabanas, surf, 2D/3D stadium, theatre plan, bus route map), each with its own step order; a toggle switches back to one decision per screen. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — All web products and flows available · DI-1084)*
- Mobile app must not open straight into booking (client found it unclear). Tabs: Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references), with a persistent "Buy tickets" button on every screen (raised centre button, or floating / flat per venue). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tabs Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets, persistent Buy tickets · DI-1081)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Optional intro video on opening the app, with a "Skip introduction" control. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1020)*
- A persistent "Buy tickets" button appears on every screen of the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1017)*
- Mobile tabs: Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1016)*
- The current mobile build goes straight into the booking journey and the client finds it unclear: redesign the UI. All web products and flows, including cabanas and surf, must remain available. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1015)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Accreditation is primarily completed in the web portal (document upload and photo checks suit a larger screen); the same submission is also available in the guest mobile app as a secondary option for individuals. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.8 Accreditation Channel Placement & API Access · DI-666)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

### Screen by screen

**`GST-014` Ticket Transfer**

- Duplicate screens become one implementation covering several screen IDs (mobile Transfer + Delivery & Sharing; web Wishlist / Devices & Consent; Help Centre + Help & Accessibility as one Help view with FAQ, cases, policies, accessibility tabs). Ticket-selection functions belong on GST-008. Web gets a Group Booking view. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, GAP-D3 · D. Duplicate screens merged; group booking on web · DI-1078)*
- A purchased ticket can be transferred to another guest (e.g. a friend); the system keeps the original purchaser and full transfer history. *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.9 Ownership and transfer · DI-669)*
- Once activated in the app a digital ticket is bound to one approved device; moving to a new device requires deactivating the prior binding. Credential transfer moves a ticket to another person's device and invalidates the original holder's copy. *(client request · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.8 Device Binding, Credential Transfer & Revocation · DI-636)*
- Ticket transfer by email/SMS with optional message; either keep ownership and rename the holder, or transfer both ownership and holder. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-200)*

**`GST-016` My Reservations**

- Booking statuses: draft > reserved (awaiting payment) > completed, with cancelled or expired paths. Hold policy sets how long a capacity booking is held pending payment before release to inventory. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.11 Order & Reservation Management · DI-612)*
- Guest profile shows gift vouchers and a stored-value "money card"/wallet; "My Tickets" (all tickets) is separate from "My Reservations" (bookings holding one or more tickets) with reservation details and date modification. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-199)*

**`GST-017` Reservation Details**

- Booking statuses: draft > reserved (awaiting payment) > completed, with cancelled or expired paths. Hold policy sets how long a capacity booking is held pending payment before release to inventory. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.11 Order & Reservation Management · DI-612)*
- Decision (raised by Chinmay): date-change/reschedule is a product-level on/off setting with its own policy rules (e.g. allowed up to 24 hours before the visit, denied within 24 hours), not a separate screen. Typically off for special-day tickets (e.g. New Year, 1 January only), on for standard GA. *(agreed · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.3 Ticket Type Deep-Dive; 5. Key Decisions · DI-446)*
- Guest profile shows gift vouchers and a stored-value "money card"/wallet; "My Tickets" (all tickets) is separate from "My Reservations" (bookings holding one or more tickets) with reservation details and date modification. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.3 B2C Guest App — End-to-End Booking Journey · DI-199)*

**`GST-044` Multi-Currency & Pricing**

- A currency selector (AED, SAR, USD, INR, GBP) converts every displayed price. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-7 · Currency (AED/SAR/USD/INR/GBP) · DI-1071)*

  "description": "**`openDated` added 24 August** from the client's *Create Ticket Flow* board, which names six main ticket types and this was the one with no kind: **valid on any date within an eligible range, rather than for a named performance or a fixed date.**\nThe mechanism already existed — `access.entitlement` carries `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `entries_allowed` and `frozen_days`, which is exactly an open-dated pass. **What was missing was the product saying it is one**, so a catalogue could not offer it and a report could not count it.\n**`datedAdmission` is a different thing and the two were being conflated**: dated is *this Tuesday*, open-dated is *any Tuesday between March and June*. A guest buying the second and being sold the first has bought the wrong ticket.\n**Transport uses two existing kinds, not a new one** (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-21). A one-way trip is `timedAdmission`: `transport.createTransportRoute` creates the route's product with one variant per passenger type, and each departure is a performance. A multi-trip or unlimited pass is `openDated`: `transport.createTransportPassType` creates it, with `EntitlementTemplate.entriesAllowed` = the pass's trips (null for unlimited), the validity = `validityDays`, and `EntitlementTemplate.transportRestriction` naming the station pair the pass was bought for, so `access` refuses it on another journey. The sale path is unchanged: both are cart lines, priced by `transport.quoteTransportFare` (orders `TransportLineAttributes`).\n",
