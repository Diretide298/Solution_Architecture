## Who this is for

**staff on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 19 permissions apply here:
  `ACCESS_OVERRIDE, ACCESS_VALIDATE, AI_USE, ATTENDANCE_RECORD, ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_DISCOUNT, ORDER_EXCHANGE, ORDER_MODIFY, ORDER_REFUND, ORDER_REPRINT, ORDER_RESCHEDULE, ORDER_VIEW`…. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **16 of these operations work offline**: applyManualDiscount, createOrder, getCurrentShift, getOrder, holdOrder, listCatalogueBundles, listOrderRefunds, listOrders
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*

- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print).

- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P06 Venue Staff App

- From the case screen agents act on the customer's bookings/tickets (date change, reschedule, resend tickets), initiate refunds/compensation, route for internal approval, or escalate to another department, which sees it on that department's mobile app. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.1 Customer Service & Contact Center (Case Management) · DI-542)*
- Client boards (POS Frontline, F&B, Retail, Inventory & Procurement) share one architecture: six boards of ten screens per domain, a command centre first and an AI/analytics board last, under the hierarchy Company > Venue > Department > Workstation > Operator/Shift > Transaction > Exception > Reconciliation > Analytics. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Opening / What the boards give us · DI-400)*
- Staff-facing POS and tablet UIs always carry TICVAI branding, not client branding. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-296)*
- Approval screens offer Approve, Reject, Return and Request More Information, show an AI-generated approval summary beside the request, and a visible trail of who approved at each stage (e.g. IT → Ops Manager → Finance → CEO → IT publishes). *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.5 Multi-Stage Approval Workflow · DI-235)*
- Two separate apps: an access-control app (handhelds or fixed terminals) scoped purely to entry validation/scanning, and an employee app (approvals, alerts/messages, matrix features) that may include a basic ticket-validity lookup but not full scanning. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 12. Mobile Application Strategy · DI-128)*
- Offline state must be clearly visible in the UI, e.g. a visible mode indicator or greyed-out unavailable functions; exact visual treatment to be settled in the UI/UX session. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-072)*
- Allam: the app detects loss of connectivity and switches to offline mode automatically, without cashier action, then restores online mode and syncs pending transactions automatically. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-071)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Allam: the platform is device-agnostic (Android, iOS and web) so sales can continue on any available device. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 8. Point-of-Sale Data Sync Strategy · DI-068)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*

### In P06 · Operations

- Employee app navigation: Work Orders, Task & Assets, Inventory/Safety/Inspections, Attendance, Approvals/Requests, Incidents, Communications, Venue Map; plus employee ID/profile and preferences. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.2 Core Navigation & Modules · DI-228)*

### Screen by screen

**`EMP-014` Ticket lookup**

- Ticket lookup shows the complete scan history: purchaser, gate and timestamp for every attempt. Security can manually override to admit a guest despite a scan issue; every override is logged against the visitor's record. *(client request · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.16 Ticket Lookup & Manual Override · DI-649)*
- Ticket look-up shows the ticket's full consumption history: transaction date/time, number of scans, expiry, and (if applicable) wallet balance and F&B/retail spend against that ticket. *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.7 Entitlements & Access Control · DI-462)*

**`EMP-015` Group scan**

- Group tickets can carry one shared QR code or individual QR codes, with partial check-in tracking; family tickets bundle adult/child pricing. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 4. Ticket Catalogue & Product Types · DI-137)*

**`EMP-017` Sync & reconciliation**

- Scanning must be native/installable and work fully offline, storing scans locally and syncing when connectivity returns. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.7 Ticket Scanning / Access Control App · DI-240)*
- After reconnection, offline records sync in batches in the order events occurred, tagged with both the original recorded time and the sync time; syncing must not slow gate entry. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 7. Ticket Validation & Offline Architecture · DI-065)*

**`EMP-018` Offline package**

- Scanning must be native/installable and work fully offline, storing scans locally and syncing when connectivity returns. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.7 Ticket Scanning / Access Control App · DI-240)*

**`EMP-019` AI assistant — home**

- The AI assistant answers natural-language business queries (e.g. "what was yesterday's ticketing revenue?") only within the user's role (a CEO sees full revenue, a cashier does not), shows grounded citations naming the policy or document an answer came from, and keeps conversation context ("compare that to this week"). *(client request · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.8 Core AI Platform — AI Assistant (Query & Knowledge) · DI-964)*

**`EMP-020` AI assistant — answer**

- The AI assistant answers natural-language business queries (e.g. "what was yesterday's ticketing revenue?") only within the user's role (a CEO sees full revenue, a cashier does not), shows grounded citations naming the policy or document an answer came from, and keeps conversation context ("compare that to this week"). *(client request · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.8 Core AI Platform — AI Assistant (Query & Knowledge) · DI-964)*

**`EMP-021` Roster**

- Staff see shift timings and upcoming shifts, clock in/out, and submit leave requests in the app. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.6 Roster, Leave & Break Management, Resources · DI-236)*

**`EMP-022` My rota**

- Employee mobile app: staff see their assigned bookings and tasks for the day, perform check-in/check-out and shift closing, and request swaps directly from the app — mirroring the booking info on their back-office profile. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.5 Staff / Personnel; 4.9 AI Optimization, Mobile App & Analytics · DI-492)*
- Staff see shift timings and upcoming shifts, clock in/out, and submit leave requests in the app. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.6 Roster, Leave & Break Management, Resources · DI-236)*

**`EMP-023` Swap request**

- Employee mobile app: staff see their assigned bookings and tasks for the day, perform check-in/check-out and shift closing, and request swaps directly from the app — mirroring the booking info on their back-office profile. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.5 Staff / Personnel; 4.9 AI Optimization, Mobile App & Analytics · DI-492)*
- Staff can request a swap (e.g. break coverage) from another resource; attendance exceptions are marked manually (active, not active, absent, other). *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.6 Workforce Rostering; 4.9 AI Optimization, Mobile App & Analytics · DI-491)*

**`EMP-024` Clock in / out**

- Employee mobile app: staff see their assigned bookings and tasks for the day, perform check-in/check-out and shift closing, and request swaps directly from the app — mirroring the booking info on their back-office profile. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.5 Staff / Personnel; 4.9 AI Optimization, Mobile App & Analytics · DI-492)*
- Shift templates (morning/afternoon/evening) define working patterns; the system recognises which shift a staff member has logged into from the configured shift timings. Leave/absence types and quotas work as a lightweight HR module, optionally integrated with an external HR/time-and-attendance system. *(client request · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.5 Staff / Personnel Resource Management · DI-487)*
- Staff see shift timings and upcoming shifts, clock in/out, and submit leave requests in the app. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 5.6 Roster, Leave & Break Management, Resources · DI-236)*
