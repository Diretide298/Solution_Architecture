## Why this batch is drawn

No view in the POS v2 build or the approved build. The frames on disk were drawn in Claude Design on 29 September in the approved build's style; draw them again in v2's look (handoff/design-batches/apps/2-pos/README.md). POS-009 and POS-015 build on v2's shift panel, without 'Expected in drawer' (POS v2 decision POSV2-3). The look to match is `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_v2.html` (its shift panel: `wireframes/incoming/P04-pos-v2/img/v2-shift.jpg`), not the approved build below.

## Who this is for

**staff on posTerminal.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 23 permissions apply here:
  `ASSET_LIBRARY_VIEW, ATTENDANCE_RECORD, CASH_LIFT, CASH_NO_SALE, ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_EXCHANGE, ORDER_VIEW, OVERSHORT_ACCEPT, PRODUCT_CONFIGURE, PRODUCT_VIEW, REPORT_VIEW_VENUE, REPORT_VIEW_WORKSTATION`…. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **16 of these operations work offline**: createCashMovement, getCurrentShift, getMediaAsset, getMediaEntitlements, getShift, getVenueSettings, listCashMovements, listDepositBoxes
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.

## The screens

| id | name | pattern | ops | overlays | machine |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POS-009` | Staff Roster | approvalInbox | 17 | 10 | — |
| `POS-010` | Add to Existing Ticket | statusTracker | 5 | 2 | — |

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*

- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P04 Venue POS

- No driver is ever installed on the workstation OS: drivers are built into the TICVAI app; staff only connect the device and test print/scan from within the app; new models are supported by a back-end driver update, not a code release. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.4 Device Inventory, Configuration Templates & Driver Management · DI-897)*
- Qossai: dim/fade the background ("foggy") when a side panel or modal opens so the cashier's attention stays on the active task. *(client request · MoM 9 Sep 2026, 4.13 POS Prototype Review - Home Screen, Ticketing Cart & Link-to-Sale UX · DI-785)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Funding approval rules: a top-up above a configured threshold requires supervisor or finance approval via supervisor login. Top-up reversal (full or partial, back to the original payment method) requires manual verification/authorisation before processing. *(agreed · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding, Top-Up & Reload Management · DI-520)*
- Top-up rules set minimum and maximum amounts per transaction; channel/funding-source mapping restricts which payment methods each channel offers (e.g. cash top-up on-site only, not online), so each channel's top-up screen offers only its allowed methods. *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding, Top-Up & Reload Management · DI-517)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Client boards (POS Frontline, F&B, Retail, Inventory & Procurement) share one architecture: six boards of ten screens per domain, a command centre first and an AI/analytics board last, under the hierarchy Company > Venue > Department > Workstation > Operator/Shift > Transaction > Exception > Reconciliation > Analytics. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Opening / What the boards give us · DI-400)*
- Allam/Qossai: the workstation/till/POS wireframes are reference only (partly ChatGPT-generated, with errors) and not to be replicated; Softlabs may consolidate dashboards freely and must cross-check the functionality matrix for missing items. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 11. Wireframe Walkthrough — Workstation, Till & POS Management · DI-312)*
- Staff-facing POS and tablet UIs always carry TICVAI branding, not client branding. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-296)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Each device gets a unique workstation ID, but what a user sees is set by their role, not the device: e.g. a cashier sees the full park ticket range at a main-gate POS but only the F&B menu at a restaurant POS. Applies to the roaming "flying" POS too. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 2. Flying POS Setup and Permission Configuration · DI-246)*
- Built-in help menu with step-by-step tutorials with screenshots for common tasks (e.g. how to sell a ticket at the POS). *(client request · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 8. Legacy POS Layout Designer & System Logging · DI-160)*
- In-system task assignment between staff (e.g. a cashier flagging something for a supervisor) without email or messaging apps. *(client request · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 8. Legacy POS Layout Designer & System Logging · DI-159)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- F&B is reached from the same top-level navigation as other experiences (tours, guides); table management only appears for venues with a restaurant configuration. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 5. Table Management & Dining Service Models · DI-107)*
- Allam: the cashier design must work consistently across all cashier device types: POS terminals, tablets, iPads and kiosks. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 3. UX Design Approach Discussion · DI-101)*
- Prefer the demoed cleaner, better-spaced layout over the cluttered PDF: adequate spacing and large touch targets to prevent mis-taps on touchscreens and tablets. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 3. UX Design Approach Discussion · DI-100)*
- Shift-level settings: light/dark mode, currency selection (displayed pricing follows the cashier's location), language selection, screen brightness, and manual online/offline toggling. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-098)*
- Notification system with ticket alerts (cancellations, capacity nearing or at its limit) and system alerts (printer offline, POS offline). *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-093)*
- Embedded AI assistant the cashier can query directly, e.g. to find today's promo code, process a refund, or switch between light/night themes. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-092)*
- Header metrics show tickets sold and revenue for the current shift. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-090)*
- **Open question.** Allam: alongside search, provide always-visible "hot function" buttons for high-frequency actions (refund, check transaction, print last receipt). Softlabs to recommend the right balance of hot buttons and search. *(open · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 3. UX Design Approach Discussion · DI-088)*
- A prominent search ("magic banner") lets the cashier reach functionality such as refunds or resending a ticket by searching, rather than through static menus or sidebars. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-087)*
- Qossai's demoed cashier interface is the primary reference/baseline, to be enhanced and redesigned enough that it does not look like a copy while keeping its UX ideas; the earlier AI-generated PDF is secondary colour/theme inspiration only. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-086)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- POS product names and menus may be Arabic-only for certain regions. *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-082)*
- Selling a capacity-based product (e.g. seat-assigned tickets) while offline is blocked with a clear notification, never allowed through or silently failing; non-capacity products stay sellable offline. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-074)*
- Qossai: the POS raises an alert when a venue goes offline. *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-073)*
- Offline state must be clearly visible in the UI, e.g. a visible mode indicator or greyed-out unavailable functions; exact visual treatment to be settled in the UI/UX session. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-072)*
- Allam: the app detects loss of connectivity and switches to offline mode automatically, without cashier action, then restores online mode and syncs pending transactions automatically. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-071)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Full card numbers are never stored or shown; only a masked representation (e.g. last four digits) so the user can identify which card was used. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 10. Compliance & Data Protection · DI-069)*
- Allam: the platform is device-agnostic (Android, iOS and web) so sales can continue on any available device. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 8. Point-of-Sale Data Sync Strategy · DI-068)*
- **Open question.** Qossai asked whether a cashier on a tablet could use the POS via a browser URL. A lightweight web POS will be considered; it would have no offline support (installed thick client required for offline). *(open · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 8. Point-of-Sale Data Sync Strategy · DI-067)*
- **Open question.** POS catalogue: Chinmay's middle ground is an online real-time catalogue that falls back automatically to the last-synced catalogue if connectivity is lost; local-first vs online-first still to be compared (case study). *(open · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 8. Point-of-Sale Data Sync Strategy · DI-066)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- POS: sell tickets, memberships, F&B, retail and services from one unified cashier experience. Access Control: real-time entry validation, occupancy monitoring, offline mode and gate management. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) - 04 Point of Sale; 03 Access Control · DI-035)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- POS must keep selling general admission tickets during an internet outage, and access-control apps must keep scanning and validating tickets during a connectivity failure. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 15. Offline POS and Access-Control Operations · DI-012)*

### In P04 · Sell

- A guest is not repeatedly re-offered something already declined (e.g. a fast pass rejected three times), and an offer ignored online is not re-presented on another channel, e.g. at POS after the guest bought it there. *(agreed · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.6 Personalized Offer Delivery & Omni-Channel Orchestration · DI-962)*
- Navigation depends on ticket type: admission has no date/time and goes straight to quantity/cart; dated asks date only; timed asks date then time; seated asks date, then time, then seat. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-116)*
- Add-to-cart offers upsell add-ons, including an AI-generated upsell prompt (e.g. suggesting the cashier add two more items to unlock a bundle discount). *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 2. Point-of-Sale (Cashier) UI Walkthrough · DI-096)*
- A "Build Your Experience" workflow helps cashiers sell bundled experiences without searching through hundreds of ticket types. *(client request · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 1. POS Design Reference and Functional Walkthrough · DI-010)*
- POS allows notes to be added against individual tickets in the cart. *(client request · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 1. POS Design Reference and Functional Walkthrough · DI-005)*

### Screen by screen

**`POS-009` Staff Roster**

- Shift management: assignment and scheduling by cashier/department, templates and policies, opening/closing, exceptions/alerts. Allam: explore merging shift-closing and till-closing screens to reduce dashboard count. *(client request · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 11. Wireframe Walkthrough — Workstation, Till & POS Management · DI-309)*

**`POS-010` Add to Existing Ticket**

- Upgrade eligibility checks validity/usage. Cases: seated ticket to a better section same day, paying the difference at the counter; general admission to season pass with the amount paid credited. Windows: before use, after use within a window, or until a cutoff (event ticket until the guest exits). *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.9 Ticket Upgrade & Downgrade Configuration · DI-603)*
- The till can add an item to an existing ticket (e.g. a locker) after the sale; not in the delivered mockups. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, (cited as CF-58 in POS-010 notes) · DI-314)*
- Add-on entitlements (e.g. a locker) are linked to the existing ticket QR by scanning it, not issued as a new QR. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-295)*

**`POS-015` Cash Operations Dashboard**

- Till/cash management shows total cash and card transactions and variance tracking, and supports cash-in/cash-out for mid-shift cash pickups. *(client request · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 11. Wireframe Walkthrough — Workstation, Till & POS Management · DI-308)*
