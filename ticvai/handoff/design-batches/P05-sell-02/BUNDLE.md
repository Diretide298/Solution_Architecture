## Who this is for

**guest on kiosk.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 3 permissions apply here:
  `ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `KSK-011` | Collect a booking | B–D | 1 | 16 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 6 | guest | notStarted (generated) |
| `KSK-012` | Booking found | B–D | 8 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 0 | 6 | guest | notStarted (generated) |
| `KSK-013` | Call staff | B–D | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | guest | notStarted (generated) |
| `KSK-014` | Out of service | B–D | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | guest | notStarted (generated) |
| `KSK-016` | Order Food | B–D | 23 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 0 | 0 | guest | notStarted (generated) |
| `KSK-017` | Shop | B–D | 31 | 27 | 6 | 8 | 1 | 0 | guest | notStarted (generated) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**KSK-011, KSK-013, KSK-014 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lookup shop and drop (primary button) | `lookupShopAndDrop` GET `/shop-and-drop/lookup` | — | ShopAndDrop[] | 400 No identifier supplied | — |

**Data it reads**: `getOrder` (onLoad, Read an order)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-012` Booking found: *Booking found*; carries `orderId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The collect booking, read by `getOrder`. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the collect booking untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No collect booking yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `getOrder` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | Not available |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 No identifier supplied |

#### Permissions

- `lookupShopAndDrop` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `getOrder` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `ORDER_VIEW`, which `getOrder` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

4 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

### `KSK-013` Call staff

**Get a human, without leaving the kiosk.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `marketing` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · light theme |
| Pattern | configEditor (touchLarge density): the screen declares only writes (`endKioskAssist`) and no read of a population — it is settings, not a list |
| Offline | Shows the counter location |
| Opens with | `sessionId` (session) · cold entry: Resolves from the session; a cold arrival is the ordinary case. |
| Route | `/sell/call-staff` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written. **Device audience on a guest surface.** `endKioskAssist` is called by the kiosk, not by the guest — **the guest presses a button and the device raises the call**, which is why the operation authenticates as a device and authorises nothing. A guest cannot end an assist session they did not start.

**Known gaps.** **`endKioskAssist` declares no request body shape**, so nothing says what this editor edits. The fields cannot be derived and the screen needs the contract before it needs a designer.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| End kiosk assist (primary button) | `endKioskAssist` POST `/kiosk-assists/{sessionId}/end` | — | KioskAssistSession | — | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Alerting staff |
| Error (`?state=error`) | **Cannot reach staff.** Shows the counter location and opening hours instead of a spinner |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | Not applicable |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | Shows the counter location |

#### Permissions

- `endKioskAssist` → no permission · device

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

### `KSK-014` Out of service

**Fail in a way that does not strand anybody.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · light theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (touchLarge density): **the screen's operations choose no pattern** — no list, no get, no write that groups. It falls to the default, and the fallback is recorded rather than passed off as a decision |
| Offline | This is the offline state. It does not attempt a cached sale |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/sell/out-of-service` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written.

**Known gaps.** **This screen declares no operation the contracts recognise.** Nothing fills it, nothing it does is committed anywhere, and its shape below is a default rather than a reading.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

### `KSK-016` Order Food

**Order food from the kiosk and collect it.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `fnb` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · light theme |
| Pattern | statusTracker (touchLarge density): `getGuestMenu` reads one record and nothing reads a population — the screen is about that one thing |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `outletId` (deepLink) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared ticket, a forwarded confirmation … |
| Route | `/sell/order-food` |

**What the spec says about it.** BL-066. **Every operation existed and no screen called them** — `getGuestMenu` and `createGuestFnbOrder` are contracted and guest-callable, and P05 had fifteen screens selling neither food nor merchandise.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| At | date and time picker | — | — | `getGuestMenu` ?at |
| Language | language picker | — | — | `getGuestMenu` ?language |

**Form: Create guest F&B order** (modal, opened by *Create guest F&B order*; *Create guest F&B order* calls `createGuestFnbOrder`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `createGuestFnbOrder` sends before it is called.** Required: `id`, `lines`, `quotedTotal`, `recordedAt`. Optional: `locationSessionId`, `outletId`, `fulfilment`, `paymentMethod`. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

Errors to draw in the form: 402 Payment required or declined; 409 An item became unavailable, the quoted total no longer matches, the location session expired, or the outlet stopped taking orders.; 422 The order breaks the outlet's `FnbDeliveryPolicy`. Names the rule in `refusedReason`.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**The guest menu** (detail panel, from `getGuestMenu`)

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Outlet | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Menu | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Name | text | — |
| In force until | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | When this menu stops applying. The client shows it, because a guest browsing breakfast at 10:55 should know. |

**Card list** (card list): Photographs, because **a guest at a kiosk with a queue behind them is not reading descriptions**

**Banner** (banner): Allergens shown on the card, not behind a tap. **contains and mayContain are different claims** and a fryer shared with breaded fish makes chips a fish risk

**Data it reads**: `getGuestMenu` (onLoad, The menu for this outlet)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-017` Shop: *Shop*; carries `outletId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The menu, with the first category open |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load the menu. **The kiosk still sells tickets** — one outlet being unreachable does not close the kiosk. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | Nothing is being served right now. **The state names the next service time** — a guest at a kiosk at 4pm needs to know whether to wait twenty minutes or go elsewhere. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches that filter. **Allergen filters narrow hard** — a guest filtering for nut-free at a nut-heavy outlet should be told that plainly rather than shown a blank menu. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Not applicable — a kiosk menu is public. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 An item became unavailable, the quoted total no longer matches, the location session expired, or the outlet stopped taking orders.; 422 The order breaks the outlet's `FnbDeliveryPolicy`. Names the rule in `refusedReason`. |

#### Permissions

- `getGuestMenu` → no permission · guest, staff
- `createGuestFnbOrder` → no permission · guest

**A refused user sees:** Not applicable — a kiosk menu is public.

#### Requirements it meets

5 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

**What the spec says about it.** BL-066, BL-019. **A guest can browse and reserve and not buy**, which is where retail stops for a guest surface — `createRetailSale` is a till operation. **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added addCartLine, lookupMerchandise. **A guest does not know which surface they are on** — the same named screen on web and app now calls the same guest-callable operations.

#### Requirements it meets

8 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Stock is centralised per venue across web, app, kiosk and POS and not shared across venues; sale is gated by the system-recorded stock (an outlet with no system stock cannot sell even if physically present); inter-venue stock transfer moves stock. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-294)*

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (31), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (27 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#KSK-017?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Add, Reserve for collection, Reserve merchandise, Add cart line, Lookup merchandise.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `KSK-016`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 1 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Never configurable:** The *Powered by TICVAI* credit in the footer is fixed and never client-editable (MoM 3 Aug, DI-111; MoM 12 Aug, DI-250). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P05 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the newest client-approved guest look. The kiosk is the same product, narrower.
- `wireframes/reference/Kiosk Board 1.dc.html`: the client's kiosk board, for layout (and Kiosk Board 2).

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

**Workshop tracker rows about P05 as a whole** (6: 0 open, 6 closed). Open first; a closed row says where it went on 30 September.

- **A54** Design centralized, venue-level inventory model with an inter-venue stock-transfer workflow, ensuring sales across web/mobile/kiosk/POS channels all draw from the same system-recorded stock (not physical stock) per venue *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker)*
- **A56** Confirm and implement branding rules across surfaces: TICVAI branding (with "Powered by TICVAI") on staff-facing POS/tablet devices, and white-labeled, client-branded UI on guest-facing kiosks *(Softlabs Design Team · Medium · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker)*
- **A192** Design a single-matrix channel-and-variant pricing view (adult/child × onsite/online/kiosk), benchmarked against the referenced competitor tool *(Softlabs Design Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S9 (final UI/UX) · 31 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A226** Build facial recognition in two tiers (Face Pass for memberships, Face Tag for single visits) with enrolment via app, web, POS, kiosk or turnstile, plus re-enrolment and fallback media *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 2 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A246** Support virtual queue via app (theme parks) and kiosk/wristband scan (water parks) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 7 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A290** Build redemption tickets/rewards, card lifecycle, live monitoring and self-service kiosk *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 11 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P05 Guest Kiosk

- Allam: water-park guests rarely carry phones, so a kiosk at the ride lets a guest scan their wristband to book a queue slot and get a return time, then scan the wristband again to enter. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.14 Virtual Queue - Multi-Venue Applicability · DI-677)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Top-up rules set minimum and maximum amounts per transaction; channel/funding-source mapping restricts which payment methods each channel offers (e.g. cash top-up on-site only, not online), so each channel's top-up screen offers only its allowed methods. *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding, Top-Up & Reload Management · DI-517)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Kiosks are guest-facing: white-labelled to the client's branding like the guest website, while keeping a kiosk-specific layout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-298)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Allam: the cashier design must work consistently across all cashier device types: POS terminals, tablets, iPads and kiosks. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 3. UX Design Approach Discussion · DI-101)*
- Selling a capacity-based product (e.g. seat-assigned tickets) while offline is blocked with a clear notification, never allowed through or silently failing; non-capacity products stay sellable offline. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-074)*

### In P05 · Sell

- A guest is not repeatedly re-offered something already declined (e.g. a fast pass rejected three times), and an offer ignored online is not re-presented on another channel, e.g. at POS after the guest bought it there. *(agreed · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.6 Personalized Offer Delivery & Omni-Channel Orchestration · DI-962)*
- Navigation depends on ticket type: admission has no date/time and goes straight to quantity/cart; dated asks date only; timed asks date then time; seated asks date, then time, then seat. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-116)*

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
