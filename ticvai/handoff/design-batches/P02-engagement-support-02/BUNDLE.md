## Who this is for

**guest on mobileApp.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 1 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **2 of these operations work offline**: getVisitPlan, getWaitTimes
  — and the rest do not. A surface that looks the same online and off is lying.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale)

A guest finds something to do, picks when and how many, holds capacity, pays, and receives a ticket they can show at the gate, transfer or resell. The same booking engine serves the guest website (P01, WEB-), the guest app (P02, GST-) and, through the same catalogue, cart and order operations, the kiosk (P05), the cashier at the till (P04) and the staff handheld (P06); partners book on credit through the partner portal (P10). Guest surfaces are white-label (venue logo, colours, fonts, card layouts, step indicator style, cart placement) with "Powered by TICVAI" kept; the till and handheld stay TICVAI-branded. The booking runs in a fixed order that the client set on 29 September and confirmed on 30 September: for a dated product, the date first, then the time (hidden until a date), then the tickets (hidden until a time); undated products go straight to the tickets; product-first flows (workshops) pick the product, then the date; seated events with one performance open on the seat map, sections first, zoom into a section, pinch out to compare. Choosing a date, time or session commits nothing; capacity is held only when a quantity is set (a 15-minute basket window, 8 minutes for seats and cabanas, one extension). The guest counters (adult, child, senior, infant, person of determination) belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices, so a basket line is "<ticket> · <guest type> × <n>"; group and school products start from group ticket cards and a typed headcount (minus, plus, and +10 on the app), supervisors free. Help me choose filters the catalogue on the server (never a consent step) with Show everything; consent questions such as "Are you able to swim?" are asked once after the session is picked and never again where the page already asked. Sign-in or the six-digit guest code is asked when the guest leaves Add-ons (or at payment, per venue), only the fields the venue configured; after the code, only the T&Cs tick remains (W1). Payment creates the order first and treats an unknown outcome as "checking with your bank", never a second charge; tickets issue on payment, go to Apple or Google Wallet, and a dynamic-QR event's ticket lives in the app. The guest app is deliberately not a copy of the website (30 September): its structure is Home, Explore, Plan and Tickets tabs with a persistent Buy tickets button, item pages that propose the right product (a restaurant's meal combo that includes admission), ride videos that play with no loader, a visit planner that plans each day at one park from that park's rides, dining and shops only, and in-park walking navigation; the booking flow inside it is functionally identical to the web. Vocabulary in guest copy follows the glossary's recorded exceptions (Booking, Session, QR). source: [F01, F02, F03, F07, F49, F52, F55, F57, F58, F59, MoM 29 Sep 1 (W1-W12), MoM 29 Sep 2, MoM 29 Sep 3, MoM 30 Sep 4.4-4.8, CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP 1-6, CLIENT-RESPONSE-REV3-25SEP, REV3-1, REV3-2, REV3-3, REV3-4, REV3-26, DI-1086 …

### Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers)

Customer & marketing is how a venue knows its guests and talks to them. There is ONE guest profile per person across ticketing, F&B and retail, so a guest who books online and later dines is the same profile (DI-339). A profile needs at least an email or a mobile, never neither (DI-372). Profiles are created by registration, by guest checkout, or by staff at a till or desk. Repeat guest checkouts with the same verified email or phone attach to the same profile automatically (DI-941, R120 default). Two records that might be the same person are NEVER merged automatically: the guest is asked to confirm, and an admin review queue runs alongside (DI-377). Each candidate shows why it matched; the record that loses is superseded, not deleted; consent takes the narrower of the two positions (DI-808). Around the profile sit three things that must never be confused. CONSENT is what the law allows: per purpose and per channel, append-only, with the notice version and the source (recordConsent). It is Given, Withdrawn or Not asked. A SUBSCRIPTION is what the guest asked to receive, e.g. a newsletter list (MarketingSubscription). A PREFERENCE is what they like: table, dietary, accessibility (updateGuestPreferences). An anonymous visitor's cookie decision is recorded against a device key (recordDeviceConsent) and attaches to the guest when they sign in (claimDeviceConsent). Marketing consent at GUEST CHECKOUT is an open client question, and the design follows its default: an unticked opt-in beside the terms, one per channel and purpose. It is recorded with source "checkout" against the order and the verified contact, and nothing is sent without it. Whether that is sufficient consent under PDPL is the client DPO's call (M18-15 (audit R-M18-15), DI-954, DI-940). Marketing reads profiles through SEGMENTS (rules, evaluated when used) and static LISTS (imported). It reaches guests by CAMPAIGNS (one send to an audience) and JOURNEYS (automations started by an event, with waits and branches). Journeys may offer only pre-configured offers, never a free-typed discount (MoM 2026-08-20 4.6). Everything goes through ONE communications module that every other module uses (MoM 2026-08-31 4.6). Consent and suppression are applied at send time, and the number excluded, with the reasons, is reported before anything goes out (launchCampaign). Transactional messages (tickets, receipts, queue calls, case replies) do not need marketing consent and must never carry marketing. LOYALTY pays for spend: points, tiers, rewards and expiry. GAMIFICATION pays for behaviour: challenges, badges, streaks, referrals and leaderboards (createChallenge). A guest reads their own loyalty position (getLoyaltyPosition). A till, the back office or support reads a named guest's (getGuestLoyalty, or identifyGuest at a till). SERVICE: one Case object covers lost property, complaints, questions, accessibility and refund requests (CaseKind). A guest raises one with raiseMyCase, which needs the connection …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

**What the spec says about it.** Minuted 10 Aug §4.9. **The in-visit half of GST-051** — one capability, two moments. ** wired 24 August.** The board drew four bespoke AI endpoints for itinerary planning; **one operation with a kind answers all of them** (ADR-0028), and recording the outcome is what lets a model replace the heuristic later. **`recordSuggestionOutcome` removed from the guest surface.** `check-screens` refused it and was right: **a guest does not record an outcome — the platform observes what they did.** A guest app that self-reports whether it took the advice is a training label the guest could forge, and the observation belongs server-side where the plan and the visit can be compared. **Deferred on 28 September (audit R187), and brought back the next day**: the itinerary planner was put in `wave: 4` with a `deferred` block and kept rather than deleted; the 29 September re-plan below superseded that, and the screen is in Block A, wave 1 (3 October 2026, CHG-SPF-006). **Itinerary suggestion removed 28 September** (decided 28 September, audit R209): the planner was deferred (R187) and `requestSuggestion` refuses a guest anything but prepPlan, upsell and waitTime, so this screen no longer asks for a day plan. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Had stayed deferred (GAP-C3); superseded the same day by the re-plan below. **Brought into Block A on 29 September** (Chinmay, the 29 September re-plan, MOB-6): a rules-based planner with the AI planner agent on top. This supersedes audit R187, the deferral half of R209 and rev 3 GAP-C3; the `deferred` block is removed and the screen is wave 1. **Mobile …

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Plan in progress: today's plan while in the venue, re-ordered against live waits. Block A. Rules-based; the guest always decides a re-order.

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **today**: Done, now and next; each ride with its live wait; a stale wait marked "as of". *(source: screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-059 (Today); screens/P01-guest-web-storefront.yaml#WEB-039 (wait time notes, R080 b))*
- **waits changed**: "Vortex is now 50 min. Swap with Lazy River (5 min) and come back at 15:30?" with Re-order my day and Keep. *(source: screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-059 (Waits changed))*

**What each action does** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Directions**: Opens the map with walking navigation to the next item. *(source: screens/P02-guest-mobile-app.yaml#GST-059 transitions; DI-1102)*

**Data it reads**: `getWaitTimes` (onLoad, Wait times across a venue); `getVisitPlan` (onLoad, The plan: days, timed items and add-on suggestions, at its …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-053` Your Plan: *See the whole plan*; carries `planId`
- → `GST-038` At the Venue: *Directions (At the Venue, Map)*
- → `GST-001` Home: *Home tab*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The plan builds in place; the inputs stay on screen. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load the plan. Names what failed; the inputs are kept so trying again costs nothing. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No plan for today: offers to make one (GST-051). |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing suits the whole party on that day (for example every ride is over a child's height): says so and offers to change the answers. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | A guest holds no permission. A plan that is not theirs says so without saying whose it is; a signed-out guest can still build a plan and is asked to sign in only to save or book it. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 `baseVersion` is not the current version (`plan-version-conflict`), or the plan is already `booked` (`plan-booked`; a booked plan is read-only, generate a new …; 422 A change names an item not on the plan, a `revertTo` version that does not exist, or a point the party is not eligible for (`item-not-eligible`, with the rule … |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `GST-053`: Same plan, today's day only.
- Match `GST-021`: Directions use the map's walking navigation.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
now: Now · Sky Swing · 15 min
next: Next · 12:30 Lunch · The Crater Grill · 6 min walk
```

#### Permissions

- `getWaitTimes` → no permission · guest, public
- `getVisitPlan` → no permission · guest
- `updateVisitPlan` → no permission · guest
- `listVisitPlanAlternatives` → no permission · guest

**A refused user sees:** A guest holds no permission. A plan that is not theirs says so without saying whose it is; a signed-out guest can still build a plan and is asked to sign in only to save or book it.

#### Requirements it meets

4 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19.2.37 | Estimated Waiting Time - System shall provide estimated waiting times. | Guest Mobile App & Branding | CONTRACTED | `getWaitTimes` |
| 5.6.3 | Display queue lengths, wait times, throughput, capacity utilization, occupancy, and customer flow metrics. | F&B & Guest Management | CONTRACTED | `getWaitTimes` |
| 5.6.15 | Continuously calculate and display estimated waiting times. | F&B & Guest Management | CONTRACTED | `getWaitTimes` |
| 5.6.16 | Allow guests to view their live queue position and estimated service time. | F&B & Guest Management | CONTRACTED | `getWaitTimes` |

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

- **A45** Design the "Plan Your Adventure" itinerary-planner feature for the guest app, including group-sharing / invite-to-itinerary functionality *(Softlabs Design Team · High · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker · names this screen)*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

### `GST-068` Help & My Cases

****A guest could not raise a complaint.** Twelve case operations existed and every one of them was staff-side — a guest with a problem had to find somebody.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P02 Guest App (mobile) |
| Module | Engagement & Support · wave 1 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #28820 (APP-MOB-GST-068) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest phone app, 390 x 844, in the venue's brand, with the v4 tab bar (Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets) and the Buy tickets button. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (comfortable density): `listCases` reads a population and nothing reads one of them; the detail is the row until a `get` exists |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** Cases already loaded stay read-only with their age, so a guest can see what they raised without believing a reply arrived. **Raising a case and replying are disabled offline** — both need the connection (decided 28 September, audit R148) — and the screen says how to … |
| Opens with | `subjectId` (session), `caseId` (navigation) · cold entry: **Resolves from the session.** A guest arriving cold is asked to sign in and returned here afterwards — never a 404, and never a screen that silently shows … |
| Route | `/account/help-my-cases` |

**What the spec says about it.** **A guest could not raise a complaint.** Twelve case operations existed and every one of them was staff-side — a guest with a problem had to find somebody. **The AI concierge and a human case are one thread here.** A conversation that could not answer becomes a case rather than a dead end, which is what `listAiConversations` beside `listCases` is for.

**From the Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers) process.** The app's Help and My Cases: the guest's cases and AI concierge conversations in one place. A conversation the assistant could not answer becomes a case rather than a dead end. Most questions never become a case, and that is the intent.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): GST-068 uses createCase and listCases, with staff filters as fields (Assigned to principal id, Breached SLA, Priority). (CHG-SGU-017); emptyNoAccess names CASE_VIEW. (CHG-GST-004).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Form: Ask for help** (modal, opened by *Ask for help*; *Ask for help* calls `raiseMyCase`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

What it is about (lost property, a complaint, a question), a short summary and the detail; optionally the visit or order it concerns, chosen from the guest's own. Nothing else is asked.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ID `id` | picker: choose an id | required | — | — | shows names, sends the id | Created on the device, so a retry after a dropped connection carries the same id and is the same case. | `raiseMyCase` body |
| Kind `kind` | select | required | — | Lost property · Complaint · Question · Accessibility · Refund request · Other; Stored on the case, because a lost-property report that forgets it was one cannot be routed to the lost and found desk.; A case raised as `other` must carry a non-empty `detail` … | — | What the guest says the case is about, in their words rather than the venue's taxonomy — `raiseMyCase` asks for it and `categoryId` is what staff file it under. | `raiseMyCase` body |
| Summary `summary` | text field | required | — | max length 200 | — | Lands in `Case.subject` — the case's one-line title. | `raiseMyCase` body |
| Recorded at `recordedAt` | date and time picker | required | — | — | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | Device time when the guest raised it. The server stamps `syncedAt` on arrival; both are kept (naming-and-style 5.2), because the SLA clock starts at `recordedAt`, not at the … | `raiseMyCase` body |
| Detail `detail` | text field | optional | — | — | — | Required, and not empty, when `kind` is `other` (decided 28 September, audit R222); a 400 otherwise. | `raiseMyCase` body |
| Venue `venueId` | picker: choose a venue | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | — | `raiseMyCase` body |
| Order ref `orderRef` | text field | optional | — | — | — | — | `raiseMyCase` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 400 `kind` is `other` and `detail` is missing or empty (audit R222), or another field breaks the schema

**Form: Reply** (modal, opened by *Reply*; *Reply* calls `replyToMyCase`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

The reply text, added to the case thread the guest raised.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Message `message` | text area | required | — | min length 1; max length 10000 | — | — | `replyToMyCase` body |

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Raise a case**: Same form and rules as WEB-025; the case id is created on the device, so a retry after a dropped connection is the same case. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#raiseMyCase)*
- **Reply**: Plain text reply on the guest's own case; the guest sees only messages addressed to them, never internal notes. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#replyToMyCase)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**My cases** (card list, from `listMyCases`): The guest's own cases (R148); no staff filters, assignee or SLA.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Case number | text | Server-assigned: the venue prefix plus a sequence per venue (decided 28 September, audit R152). |
| Subject | text | The case's one-line title, not a person. Stored as `title` so the table does not hold `subject` beside `subject_id`; the wire keeps … |
| Status | chip: Open, In progress, Awaiting guest, Escalated, Resolved, Closed | — |
| Created at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Resolved at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |

**My conversations with Sahli** (card list, from `listAiConversations`): The guest's own earlier assistant conversations, so a question already asked is not raised again as a case.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Started at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Last message at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ask for help (primary button) | `raiseMyCase` POST `/my/cases` | inline | Case | 400 `kind` is `other` and `detail` is missing or empty (audit R222), or another field breaks the schema | opens modal first |
| Reply (secondary button) | `replyToMyCase` POST `/my/cases/{caseId}/messages` | inline | CaseDetail | — | opens modal first |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Cases and conversations**: Two tabs: Cases (number, topic, status, last update) and Chats (past concierge conversations, newest first). A chat that became a case links to it. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#listMyCases; contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#listAiConversations)*

**Data it reads**: `listAiConversations` (onLoad, A principal's conversation history); `listMyCases` (onLoad, The cases this guest raised)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `GST-039` Profile: *Profile*; carries `subjectId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Content loads. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. **Says what failed and offers one way onward**, never a bare failure. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **No cases open.** The concierge sits here too — most questions never become a case, and that is the intent. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025: `x-ticvai-permission` is what a staff caller must hold; a guest call resolves to the guest's own data; decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)). No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that … |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** Cases already loaded stay read-only with their age, so a guest can see what they raised without believing a reply arrived. **Raising a case and replying are disabled offline** — both need the connection (decided 28 September, audit R148) — and the screen says how to reach staff in person instead: the guest services desk, or any member of staff. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 `kind` is `other` and `detail` is missing or empty (audit R222), or another field breaks the schema |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Offline**: Loaded cases stay read-only with their age; raising and replying are disabled; directions to the guest services desk are shown. *(source: R148)*
- **A group asks for an upgrade**: Group upgrades are raised as a request here (kind Question or Other with the booking attached), not self-served. *(source: DI-607)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-025`: Same topics, statuses and wording.
- Match `SUP-005`: What the guest writes here arrives in the agent's case thread as a guest message.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
cases:
- number: CA-1051
  topic: Accessibility
  summary: Wheelchair at the main gate on Fri
  status: Resolved
chats:
- Opening hours on public holidays - answered by the assistant
- 28 Sep 2026
```

#### Permissions

- `listAiConversations` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff, guest
- `listMyCases` → no permission · guest
- `raiseMyCase` → no permission · guest
- `replyToMyCase` → no permission · guest

**A refused user sees:** **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025: `x-ticvai-permission` is what a staff caller must hold; a guest call resolves to the guest's own data; decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)). No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that …

#### Requirements it meets

2 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8.4.29 | System shall expose AI services through APIs. | Unified Operations Dashboard | CONTRACTED | `listAiConversations` |
| 8.4.30 | System shall maintain AI interaction history. | Unified Operations Dashboard | CONTRACTED | `listAiConversations` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Group ticket upgrades are business-configurable (off by default); where allowed a group raises an upgrade request (e.g. via chat/support) rather than self-serving like an individual. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.9 Clarified (group upgrades) · DI-607)*
- Cases can be logged from the customer app/website and from the call-centre/admin side, with category, priority, channel and SLA-based escalation rules. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.8 AI Chat Box, Routing/Queue & Case Management · DI-390)*
- Support chat is native to TICVAI: a built-in AI chat assistant answers first, then escalates to a human "CR representative" role in the platform; offered white-labelled as a subscription add-on for smaller clients. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 10. Customer Support / Chat Integration Approach · DI-256)*

Also apply: 41 for all of P02, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

| Element | Configured in | Allowed values | Default | What it changes |

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Decided for every guest screen:** **No dark or light mode.** The venue's chosen theme applies on every device setting; `Theme.darkMode` is deprecated and ignored, never drawn, and the guest app has no Light/Dark switch (Chinmay, 2 October, Q150; CHG-CSA-035). ***Powered by TICVAI* is a tenant toggle, on by default** (`brand.showPoweredBy`): shown on the launch screen, at the foot of Account and in the web footer; switching it off needs the licence add-on, or 403 `powered-by-locked` (Chinmay, 2 October, Q160; DI-297; CHG-CSA-036). **Each homepage section sets its card count and its scroll animation** (`maxItems`; `scrollAnimation` rise, scale, slide, blur or none, default rise): every customisation option of the approved wireframe (Chinmay, 2 October, Q152 and Q153; DI-1088; CHG-CSA-040). **Landing-page templates.** A tenant with no landing page of its own starts from a TICVAI template (`listLandingPageTemplates`, kept as `HomepageLayout.templateKey`); one with its own site links in with deep links (`landingSource` ownSite) (Chinmay, 2 October, batch 2 #41; CHG-CSA-037).

**Never configurable:** A dark or light mode: the guest surfaces have one theme, the venue's (Chinmay, 2 October; CHG-CSA-035). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P02 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Mobile App v4.dc.html`: Mobile App v4, the newest guest look (29 September, with the 30 September feedback in the booking flows). It replaces the 28 September Mobile v2 build.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the booking engine that runs inside the app. Keep both files in the same folder.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*

- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P02 Guest App

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Products can be presented in multiple card layout styles: carousel, video poster, split, etc. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1089)*
- The home-screen navigation bar layout is configurable: home/explore/map/buy-tickets in different arrangements. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.5 Mobile App — Configuration Flexibility · DI-1087)*
- The revised mobile app design is approved in direction: Qossai liked the opening video and visual polish, Allam the UI/graphics quality. Its flow is deliberately different from the web application (after front-end team input), not a reused structure. Detailed feedback to follow. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.4 Guest Mobile App — Revised Design Walkthrough · DI-1086)*
- Every web product and flow stays bookable in the mobile app (incl. cabanas, surf, 2D/3D stadium, theatre plan, bus route map), each with its own step order; a toggle switches back to one decision per screen. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — All web products and flows available · DI-1084)*
- Mobile app must not open straight into booking (client found it unclear). Tabs: Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references), with a persistent "Buy tickets" button on every screen (raised centre button, or floating / flat per venue). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Mobile app (v4) — Tabs Home · Explore · Plan · Tickets, persistent Buy tickets · DI-1081)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Optional intro video on opening the app, with a "Skip introduction" control. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1020)*
- A persistent "Buy tickets" button appears on every screen of the mobile app. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1017)*
- Mobile tabs: Home, Explore, Plan, Tickets (Yas Island / Six Flags references). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1016)*
- The current mobile build goes straight into the booking journey and the client finds it unclear: redesign the UI. All web products and flows, including cabanas and surf, must remain available. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 2. Mobile app · DI-1015)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Accreditation is primarily completed in the web portal (document upload and photo checks suit a larger screen); the same submission is also available in the guest mobile app as a secondary option for individuals. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.8 Accreditation Channel Placement & API Access · DI-666)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- The POS/tablet application carries TICVAI's own branding and UI direction; the B2C and B2B mobile applications are white-label by design. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 15. Monday UI/UX Session Planning · DI-084)*
- Offline capability applies to POS terminals, handheld/validation devices (turnstiles, scanners), and staff and customer mobile apps. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-070)*
- Qossai: the target product is a white-label application supporting both B2C and B2B mobile use cases, built around three to four distinct flows (e.g. admission ticket flow, seat assignment flow). *(client request · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Application Flow & White-Label Requirements · DI-056)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```json

}
```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
