## Who this is for

**guest on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW, TENANT_CONFIGURE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store. Offline, a screen shows what was already loaded, under the banner below.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `WEB-001` Home / Landing

**Show a guest what is on and give them one obvious way to start booking.**

**What the spec says about it.** **Venue selection added 28 September** (decided 28 September, audit R267): a venue picker on first open, remembered on the device, **Change venue** in the header, and a visit-day suggestion from the guest's ticket. The options come from `getTenantAppStatus.venues`, the tenant's active venues, public and cacheable. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Category cards render as a grid or as one scrolling row per `BookingFlowConfig.cardLayout` (the retired `categoryDisplay` of 23SEP-18 is removed, W7). The event banner lists dates only when `BookingFlowConfig.eventBannerDates` is on (default off; 23SEP-19); the date picker always sits at the top of the booking step. The venue picked here (audit R267) is the venue whose booking-flow settings apply on every booking screen, and the booking screens' *Booking at* bar changes it (REV3-18). Every booking-flow setting named here is read from `getTenantConfig` `bookingFlow`, resolved for the venue the guest picked (audit R267): the tenant's values with that venue's `venueOverrides` entry laid over field by field (decided 29 September, rev 3 CFG-11). The UI preset stays `BookingFlowConfig.preset` (CFG-1, no change); the search box in the banner is off by default (`searchInBanner` default false, CFG-6). The in-venue notifications link is live again: WEB-046 is back in the first release (GAP-C1, reversing audit R242). **29 September.** *Plan your visit* in the header opens WEB-050 full screen (MOB-6). W7: `categoryDisplay` is retired.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Visiting today?** (banner, from `listMyEntitlements`): **On a visit day the app suggests the ticket's venue** (decided 28 September, audit R267): for a signed-in guest, an entitlement from `listMyEntitlements` (`state=upcoming`) valid today at a venue other than the chosen one offers **Switch to that venue**; the guest decides, the app never switches by itself.

**Sold out or closed today** (banner, from `getTenantAppStatus`): From `getTenantAppStatus.availability` (`open`, `soldOut`, `closed`) and `availabilityMessage` (decided 28 September, audit R073 (f)); nothing shows while it is `open`.

| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No home landing yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |

No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the … |

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

Differences: No first-open venue picker remembered on the device and no 'Change venue' in the header (YAML R267); the prototype shows 'Browse by venue' tiles instead and switches venue from the Config drawer. Prototype adds a resume-booking card, a video 'Tonight in the city' panel, live queue times on cards and footer links to Contact / Accessibility / Service status.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (3), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (79 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#WEB-001?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Search, Sign in, Change venue.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `WEB-002`, `WEB-003`, `WEB-016`, `WEB-036`, `WEB-037`, `WEB-038`, `WEB-039`, `WEB-040`, `WEB-041`, `WEB-042`, `WEB-043`, `WEB-044`, `WEB-045`, `WEB-046`, `WEB-008`, `WEB-009`, `WEB-017`, `WEB-018`, `WEB-019`, `WEB-021`, `WEB-022`, `WEB-023`, `WEB-024`, `WEB-027`, `WEB-032`, `WEB-033`, `WEB-034`, `WEB-020`, `WEB-025`, `WEB-026`, `WEB-028`, `WEB-029`, `WEB-049`, `WEB-050`, `WEB-004`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 8 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `WEB-002` Event & Attraction Listing

**Browse and filter everything bookable.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P01 Guest Web (web) |
| Module | Discovery & Browse · wave 1 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #17955 (APP-WEB-WEB-002) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest website, responsive: 1440 desktop and 390 phone widths, in the venue's brand. · LTR and RTL · light theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `listProducts` reads the population and `getWaitTimes` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Opens with | `eventId` (deepLink), `venueId` (session) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared ticket, a forwarded confirmation … |
| Route | `/discovery-and-browse/event-and-attraction-listing` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added getWaitTimes. **A guest does not know which surface they are on** — the same named screen on web and app now calls the same guest-callable operations. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Categories: tiles from `listProductCategories`, then `listProducts?categoryId=`, or one flat list, per `BookingFlowConfig.ticketCategories` (REV3-16); tiles as a grid or a row per `cardLayout` (`categoryDisplay` retired, W7). **Info-only products** (`Product.guestListing` `infoOnly`) are listed with `notBookableLabel` (default *Info only / Not bookable online*) and open their details instead of adding to the basket; they are hidden when `BookingFlowConfig.showInfoOnly` is off (REV3-14). Each card shows the product's own primary image (`Product.media` `isPrimary`, `searchCatalogue` `primaryMedia`; 23SEP-4). **Book** opens the ticket counters (WEB-005) as a side panel on this listing rather than a new page (23SEP-5). Card layout, size and density are the enums `cardLayout` [stackedRows, splitRows, cardsAcross, posterCards], `cardSize` [compact, standard, large, extraLarge] and `density` [compact, standard, roomy] (DG-6). Every booking-flow setting named here is read from `getTenantConfig` `bookingFlow`, resolved for the venue the guest picked (audit R267): the tenant's values with that venue's `venueOverrides` entry laid over field by field (decided 29 September, rev 3 CFG-11). **29 September.** W4: Help me choose filters this list, with *Show everything*. W3: view-only products show Call sales / Email sales. W7: `categoryDisplay` retired.

**Shown**

Tiles lay out as a grid or one scrolling row per `BookingFlowConfig.cardLayout` (W7).

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The event attraction listing list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the event attraction listing untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No event attraction listing yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches the filter on venueId, kind, isSellable and the event attraction listing are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025: `x-ticvai-permission` is what a staff caller must hold; a guest call resolves to the guest's own data). No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the … |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |

#### Requirements it meets

24 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Category tiles (e.g. Permanent exhibition, Temporary exhibitions, Guided tours, Courses & workshops), then that category's tickets with Adult / Child / Student counters. Setting "Ticket categories": Category → subcategory (default) or Flat list (all tickets under category headings). *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-16 · 16. Choose category, then subcategory, configurable in the CMS · DI-1056)*
- Card layout is a choice, not free text: Stacked rows (default) · Split rows · Cards across · Poster cards. Card size: Compact (default) · Standard · Large · Extra large. Density: Compact (default) · Standard · Roomy. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, 6. Booking-flow configuration (CMS-016): card-layout options · DI-1040)*
- Clicking a ticket opens the Adult / Child / Senior / Infant counters in a side panel on the same listing or details screen (no separate "Select Tickets" step); the panel is open by default on the listing and Book goes straight into the booking. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 5. Clicking Dated Day Pass should show the tickets on the same screen · DI-1027)*
- Read more opens with the ticket's video or photo, and every ticket in a listing has its own photo (product media: images and videos, one primary). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 4. Video or image should show · DI-1026)*
- CMS option to list a product (e.g. training courses) with full details but no Book button; instead show "Contact sales to book" with contact details. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W3 View-only products · DI-1004)*
- Experience venues list each experience directly (e.g. author talk, calligraphy workshop, story hour, rooftop reading night), each with its own date, time and tickets; no category step. *(client request · rev 3 design review 25 Sep 2026, 12. Experience flow: show the product directly, not the ticket category · DI-999)*
- Show the ticket categories (e.g. Single day, Two-day flexible, UAE resident) directly; no intermediate "Dated day pass" step. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Tickets 7. Show the ticket category directly instead of Dated Pass -> Single Day Pass · DI-976)*
- Allam's UX benchmark (Little Explorer, Dubai): multi-location selector, a horizontal near-term date picker with full-calendar fallback, and tabbed browsing (passes / workshops / packages) on one page rather than multiple screens. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.13 UX Reference Walkthrough (Little Explorer) · DI-585)*
- Products are grouped into categories for the tenant website (e.g. a diving operator's scuba diving, free diving, snorkelling, each listing its packages); package title, description, terms, age limits and images come from back-office fields and sync to the live site; choosing a package goes to checkout on the TICVAI booking platform. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 9. Statistical Groups & Website Content Integration · DI-161)*
- Ticket listings are data-driven: creating a new ticket automatically surfaces it on the relevant site according to its category configuration. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-109)*

Also apply: 1 for P01 · Discovery & Browse, 39 for all of P01, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

### `WEB-003` Search Results

**Find something when the guest does not know what it is called.**

| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `searchCatalogue` reads a population and nothing reads one of them; the detail is the row until a `get` exists |

| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/discovery-and-browse/search-results` |

**What the spec says about it.** Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-14).** `searchCatalogue` now also returns info-only products, flagged (`guestListing` `infoOnly`): the result shows `notBookableLabel` (default *Info only / Not bookable online*) and opens the details (WEB-004), never Add to basket. Hidden when `BookingFlowConfig.showInfoOnly` is off. Each result shows its own primary image (23SEP-4).

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The search results list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the search results untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No search results yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches the filter on q, venueId, kind and the search results are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025: `x-ticvai-permission` is what a staff caller must hold; a guest call resolves to the guest's own data). No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the … |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** Results come only from what was already loaded, with a note that newer items may exist. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 A `categoryId` that names no category of the venue, or a `guidedAnswerIds` entry that is not an answer of the venue's published guided choice (W4, 29 …; 400 A `guidedAnswerIds` entry that is not an answer of the venue's published guided choice (W4, 29 September). |

#### Permissions

- `searchCatalogue` → no permission · guest
- `listProducts` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025: `x-ticvai-permission` is what a staff caller must hold; a guest call resolves to the guest's own data). No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the …

#### Requirements it meets

15 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 1 for P01 · Discovery & Browse, 39 for all of P01, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Booking settings (tenant, with per-venue overrides)*, set in `CMS-016` Site Settings:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Show info only (`bookingFlow.showInfoOnly`) | — | on | Show info-only products (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-14). On, a product with `guestListing` `infoOnly` (catalogue) is listed with its not-bookable label and opens its details; off, guests are not shown it. |
| Settings: show info only (`bookingFlow.venueOverrides[].settings.showInfoOnly`) | — | on | Show info-only products (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-14). On, a product with `guestListing` `infoOnly` (catalogue) is listed with its not-bookable label and opens its details; off, guests are not shown it. |

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (3), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (18 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#WEB-003?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] The screen has no action of its own; nothing is drawn as a button that does nothing.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `WEB-002`, `WEB-004`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The module and platform inputs below are applied.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `WEB-004` Attraction Details

**Decide whether to book this.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P01 Guest Web (web) |
| Module | Discovery & Browse · wave 1 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #17956 (APP-WEB-WEB-004) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest website, responsive: 1440 desktop and 390 phone widths, in the venue's brand. · LTR and RTL · light theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `listPerformances` reads the population and `getProduct` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |

**What the spec says about it.** **Renamed 31 August** from *Event / Attraction Detail*. **A guest surface is one product with two renderings** — a screen named differently on web and app is two screens to a developer and one journey to a guest. **Cross-surface parity, 31 August**: added getAvailability, getWaitTimes. **A guest does not know which surface they are on** — the same named screen on web and app now calls the same guest-callable operations. **Rev 3 (decided 29 September).** Ticket tags from `Product.displayTags` when `BookingFlowConfig.ticketTags` is on (23SEP-3); Read more opens on the product's own video or photo (`Product.media`, 23SEP-4). An info-only product shows its `notBookableLabel` and no Book button (REV3-14). **Book** opens the ticket counters as a side panel here (23SEP-5); a dated product goes to the date and time first (WEB-006, REV3-2); a fixture with a single on-sale performance opens straight on the seat map with the fixture as a strip at its top (WEB-007, 23SEP-16, REV3-4); a product placed on a venue map opens the map booking (WEB-047, REV3-15); a product sold by the hour opens the space booking (WEB-048, REV3-13). The event banner lists dates only when `BookingFlowConfig.eventBannerDates` is on (default off, 23SEP-19). Help me choose sits on the booking step (WEB-005), where the prototype draws it, not here (REV3-11). **29 September.** W3: view-only products show Call sales / Email sales instead of Book. M18-13: in single-event mode, a banner or video hero and only the next seven days, with a calendar for later dates (M17-08). **Video plays directly (client meeting 30 …

**Availability** (data table, from `getAvailability`): From `getAvailability`, now a `PerformanceAvailabilityPage` (a Page of `PerformanceAvailability`, each with `startsAt`): `channelCapacityId`, `performanceId`, `startsAt`, `capacity`, `sold`, `leased`, `remaining`, `byChannel`. The time grid calls it once with `eventId`, `from` and `to` for every performance in the window (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-1), not once per tile.

**Banner** (banner): Shown only when withdrawn — reachable via a stale link but no longer sellable. A silent 404 on a shared link is a bad guest experience

**Ticket tags** (card list, from `getProduct`): Up to six tags (clock, height, free, calendar, id) with an icon by kind, e.g. *2 Hours*, *Min 1.10 m*, *Valid 90 days*.

**Photo and video** (detail panel, from `getProduct`): **The video plays directly, with no loader in front of it** (client meeting 30 September, MoM 4.8): the info button reveals the details and starts the primary video in place; the poster frame (the primary image, or the video's first frame) shows while it buffers, never a spinner or loading screen.

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | **The video is not part of loading** (client meeting 30 September, MoM 4.8): the attraction renders as it arrives and no loader or loading screen is ever drawn over the video. |
| Video buffering (`?state=videoBuffering`) | **Poster frame, not a loader** (client meeting 30 September, MoM 4.8): until the first frames arrive the poster (primary image, else the video's first frame) fills the video area and playback starts in place as soon as it can; no spinner, overlay or blocking screen. The details beside it stay usable throughout. |
| Video unavailable (`?state=videoUnavailable`) | The video cannot play (no video, a failed stream, data saver on). The poster stays and the details are unaffected; no error screen and no loader. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the attraction untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No attraction yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Qossai: ride/attraction detail pages play the video directly, with no loading screen in front of it; an info button reveals ride details and plays the video. Chinmay agreed to remove the loader. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.8 Mobile App — In-Ride Video/Info & In-Park Navigation · DI-1101)*
- The date list in the event banner (for multi-date events) is a setting, "Dates in event banner", off by default. The date picker always sits at the top of the booking step. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Settings 19. Why is there a date selection in the header? · DI-1033)*
- Clicking a ticket opens the Adult / Child / Senior / Infant counters in a side panel on the same listing or details screen (no separate "Select Tickets" step); the panel is open by default on the listing and Book goes straight into the booking. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 5. Clicking Dated Day Pass should show the tickets on the same screen · DI-1027)*
- Read more opens with the ticket's video or photo, and every ticket in a listing has its own photo (product media: images and videos, one primary). *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 4. Video or image should show · DI-1026)*
- Ticket cards, Read more and the listing side panel show tags (e.g. "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Free adult entry", "Valid 90 days", "Emirates ID"), each with a kind icon (clock, height, free, calendar, id), max 6. Venue-set tags win, else derived from duration, validity, height rule. Setting "Tags on tickets", default on. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 3. 'Read more' should carry tags customisable per ticket type · DI-1025)*
- CMS option to list a product (e.g. training courses) with full details but no Book button; instead show "Contact sales to book" with contact details. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W3 View-only products · DI-1004)*
- Show the ticket categories (e.g. Single day, Two-day flexible, UAE resident) directly; no intermediate "Dated day pass" step. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Tickets 7. Show the ticket category directly instead of Dated Pass -> Single Day Pass · DI-976)*
- Single-event mode page: banner or video hero, a brief description, and a date strip of the next seven days with a calendar for later dates. *(agreed · MoM 18 Sep 2026, M18-13 · DI-953)*
- A venue selling a single event gets a dedicated page with a banner/video and brief description, showing only the near-term available dates (e.g. next 7 days) by default. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.13 Guest Website UX Review — Ticket Type Flows & Seat Map Selection · DI-949)*
- Guest date picking shows a strip of the next seven days (venue setting dateStripDays, default 7, range 3-31) with a calendar icon that opens the full month for later dates. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, M17-08 · DI-920)*
- Qossai and Allam: product pages should include short video content (e.g. a 10-15 second clip), not only static images, to give a sense of the actual experience (e.g. a ride) before booking. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Web App — Live UI/UX Feedback Walkthrough · DI-917)*
- Allam (ref. "Little Explorer"): show only a short near-term availability window by default (e.g. next 7 days) with a calendar icon that expands to a full calendar for later dates, instead of the flat 15-day range shown. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Web App — Live UI/UX Feedback Walkthrough · DI-915)*
- Six Flags reference for the B2C redesign (Qossai): hero-banner product video. *(client request · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.20 Planning & Next Steps · DI-738)*
- Allam's UX benchmark (Little Explorer, Dubai): multi-location selector, a horizontal near-term date picker with full-calendar fallback, and tabbed browsing (passes / workshops / packages) on one page rather than multiple screens. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.13 UX Reference Walkthrough (Little Explorer) · DI-585)*
- Product cards/pages carry short descriptions with an expandable "view more details" control and a configurable hero image or video per product. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review — Six Flags Kidiya Reference Walkthrough · DI-425)*
- Platinum List reference: event page with short video + image + description → select tickets → calendar collapsed to a week view, expandable to full month → time-slot selection. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.1 Reference Walkthrough — Platinum List Seat Selection & Checkout Journey · DI-408)*
- Products are grouped into categories for the tenant website (e.g. a diving operator's scuba diving, free diving, snorkelling, each listing its packages); package title, description, terms, age limits and images come from back-office fields and sync to the live site; choosing a package goes to checkout on the TICVAI booking platform. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 9. Statistical Groups & Website Content Integration · DI-161)*

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Booking settings (tenant, with per-venue overrides)*, set in `CMS-016` Site Settings:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Event banner dates (`bookingFlow.eventBannerDates`) | — | off | Dates in event banner (decided 29 September, rev 3 23SEP-19). On, the event banner lists the next dates; off by default. |
| Ticket tags (`bookingFlow.ticketTags`) | — | on | Tags on tickets (decided 29 September, rev 3 23SEP-3). Shows a product's display tags (such as "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Valid 90 days") on its card. |
| Date strip days (`bookingFlow.dateStripDays`) | min 3; max 31 | 7 | The date strip (decided 17 September, M17-08). How many days from today the date step shows as a strip before the calendar icon that opens the full month; later dates are picked from the calendar. |
| Settings: event banner dates (`bookingFlow.venueOverrides[].settings.eventBannerDates`) | — | off | Dates in event banner (decided 29 September, rev 3 23SEP-19). On, the event banner lists the next dates; off by default. |
| Settings: ticket tags (`bookingFlow.venueOverrides[].settings.ticketTags`) | — | on | Tags on tickets (decided 29 September, rev 3 23SEP-3). Shows a product's display tags (such as "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Valid 90 days") on its card. |
| Settings: date strip days (`bookingFlow.venueOverrides[].settings.dateStripDays`) | min 3; max 31 | 7 | The date strip (decided 17 September, M17-08). How many days from today the date step shows as a strip before the calendar icon that opens the full month; later dates are picked from the calendar. |

### `WEB-050` Plan Your Visit

**Plan a visit on the website: answer six questions, get a day-by-day plan, edit it, and book it in one go.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P01 Guest Web (web) |

| Route | `/plan-your-visit` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Added 29 September**: the 29 September web build has *Plan your visit* in the header, opening the planner full screen, and *Book this plan* goes straight into booking. The web twin of the Plan tab (GST-051 questions, GST-053 plan), binding the same planner operations (venue-map `generateVisitPlan`, `getVisitPlan`, `updateVisitPlan`, `listVisitPlanAlternatives`, `bookVisitPlan`). Block A (29 September re-plan, superseding R187 and GAP-C3). Rules-based; the AI planner chat is app-only for now. Hidden when the venue turns module `visitPlanner` off. **Multi-venue intelligence (client meeting 30 September, MoM 4.7, Allam).** As on the app: each day is at one park and uses only that park's rides, dining and retail (shops and kiosks, added beside F&B); a preference the park cannot meet is said, never filled from another park.

**Data it reads**: `listProducts` (onLoad, Interests and height limits of what the planner may include); `getVisitPlan` (onLoad, The plan: days, timed items and add-on suggestions, at its …); `getTenantAppStatus` (onLoad, The tenant's active venues, for the park-per-day choice in …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `WEB-010` Shopping Cart: *Book this plan*; carries `cartId`; calls `bookVisitPlan`
- → `WEB-004` Attraction Details: *Opens an item on the plan*; carries `productId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The plan builds in place; the answers stay on screen. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not build or load the plan. Names what failed; the answers are kept. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No plan yet: the first question is shown. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing suits the whole group on that day: says which answer ruled everything out and offers to change it. |
| Preference not at venue (`?state=preferenceNotAtVenue`) | **A preference a day's park cannot meet** (client meeting 30 September, MoM 4.7): before *Make my plan* the chip is marked *Not at the parks you chose* (naming a park of the tenant that has it); after it, the day shows the *Not at this park* banner and nothing from another park is placed. *Change answers* lets the guest move that day to the park that has it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | A guest holds no permission. Anyone can build a plan; signing in is asked only to save it, and booking follows the cart's own sign-in gate. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 A `categoryId` that names no category of the venue, or a `guidedAnswerIds` entry that is not an answer of the venue's published guided choice (W4, 29 …; 409 `baseVersion` is not current (`plan-version-conflict`), or the cart is not the caller's or is no longer open (`cart-not-open`).; 409 `baseVersion` is not the current version (`plan-version-conflict`), or the plan is already `booked` … |

**A refused user sees:** A guest holds no permission. Anyone can build a plan; signing in is asked only to save it, and booking follows the cart's own sign-in gate.

#### Requirements it meets

3 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- A preference a day's park cannot meet is said, not filled: a "Not at this park" banner per day names the cuisine or shop and the park that has it (e.g. "No Indian restaurant at Summit Peaks. Indian food is at Aqua Park (day 2)."), hidden when all are met. Lunch cuisine options name the parks serving them ("Indian - Summit Peaks only"). *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.7 · DI-1113)*
- Allam: multi-venue visit planner. In a multi-venue tenant the guest picks a park per chosen day ("Which park each day?", hidden otherwise); each day tab names its park and every item, swap candidate and AI-planner suggestion comes only from that park's rides, dining and shops, never another park's. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.7 · DI-1112)*
- Retail/kiosk shops are added to the planner's venue-linked options alongside F&B (previously only F&B). *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.7 Mobile App — Itinerary Planner & Multi-Venue Intelligence · DI-1100)*
- Allam: the planner applies multi-venue intelligence; it checks actual venue-level amenities before including a preference, e.g. if only one of several parks has an Indian restaurant. It pulls only rides, F&B and retail available at each specific venue. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.7 Mobile App — Itinerary Planner & Multi-Venue Intelligence · DI-1099)*
- Itinerary planner (Yas Island planner reference): party composition (adults/children with height/age), visit dates, pace (packed/balanced/relaxed) and cuisine preferences feed an auto-generated, swappable multi-day itinerary with associated costing. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.7 Mobile App — Itinerary Planner & Multi-Venue Intelligence · DI-1098)*
- "Plan Your Adventure": guided itinerary planner (Skidata benchmark) where the guest picks which rides/attractions and in what order ahead of time, tied to the ticket purchase and saved as a personal visit profile. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.9 "Plan Your Adventure" (Itinerary Planner) · DI-217)*
- Custom content pages per venue (e.g. "Plan Your Visit", Accessibility) that follow accessibility guidelines. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-190)*

Also apply: 1 for P01 · Discovery & Browse, 39 for all of P01, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

- **A45** Design the "Plan Your Adventure" itinerary-planner feature for the guest app, including group-sharing / invite-to-itinerary functionality *(Softlabs Design Team · High · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker · keyword 'plan your adventure')*

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the fixed *Powered by TICVAI* credit). Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (10, CMS-002, CMS-004, ADM-016); Theme (31, CMS-005, CMS-003, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-007); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-007); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Make my plan, Swap / + Add something, Remove / Undo changes, Book this plan, Change answers.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `WEB-010`, `WEB-004`, `WEB-001`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 7 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Never configurable:** The *Powered by TICVAI* credit in the footer is fixed and never client-editable (MoM 3 Aug, DI-111; MoM 12 Aug, DI-250). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P01 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the website. Rev 3 with the 29 September fixes and the 30 September feedback (group booking with a headcount, multi-park counters, surf session tickets, the swim-ability answer, transport stations and departures, popular route cards; `CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP.md` beside it). The client approved it for development once W1 to W10 are in.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Visit Planner.dc.html`: the visit planner. WEB-050 Plan Your Visit is this file.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P01 Guest Web

- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Confirmed final: cart sliding in from the right or bottom, card size options, and cart-sidebar placement left or right; Qossai specifically liked the compact card size. No further changes requested. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.10 Guest Web App — Card Layout & Cart Configuration Confirmed · DI-991)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- The reviewed prototype is the actual guest-facing B2C site customers browse and book from, not a CMS tool. A separate, more limited white-label interface lets a client adjust colours, fonts and layout from a menu of options; not yet built in the prototype. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-887)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Qossai is dissatisfied with the current B2C guest platform build and wants a separate vision session; references: the "Little Explorer" site and Six Flags. Six Flags cues: single-page flow. *(client request · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.20 Planning & Next Steps · DI-736)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Configurable cookie consent banner (accept/reject) per website; some cookies flagged mandatory (non-rejectable), others optional; templated and configurable in the system. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.13 Privacy Consent & Cookie Policy · DI-617)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Six Flags Kidiya reference: fixed header with configurable navigation (logo, Explore/Tickets/Passes, sub-menus), every item toggleable via the CMS. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review — Six Flags Kidiya Reference Walkthrough · DI-424)*
- Allam: the venue's main website is fully venue-managed; after "Book Now" the white-label B2C flow keeps the venue's header/footer branding while product selection, cart and checkout are TICVAI-managed. Header/footer links to non-checkout pages redirect to the main venue site. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-397)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- A multi-language toggle switches the entire site's content. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-120)*
- Allam: banner, header, footer and background color are CMS-configurable per client, but site structure and navigation flow are fixed and adapt automatically to product configuration (dated, non-dated, seated, membership products surface the right fields). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-119)*
- All sites are fully mobile-responsive; e.g. the desktop calendar view collapses into a mobile-optimized layout. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-113)*
- A "powered by [platform]" footer credit is fixed and not client-editable. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-111)*
- One client can run multiple branded sites from the same setup, e.g. two brands sharing a footer but with distinct headers and hero banners. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-110)*
- White-label sites share one platform/template but each is configured independently: header, footer, logo, colors, fonts and hero banner are client-editable from the backend. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-108)*

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.
