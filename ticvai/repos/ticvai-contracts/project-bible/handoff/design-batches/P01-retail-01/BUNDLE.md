## Who this is for

**guest on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 3 permissions apply here:
  `ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store. Offline, a screen shows what was already loaded, under the banner below.
- **Offline, every screen shows one banner, the same on web and app:** *"You're offline. Connect to the internet to book, pay, order or join a queue."* The moment the connection drops, on every screen, above the screen's own content. By itself as soon as the connection is back, with a short "Back online" confirmation. **It never** Covers what is already on screen, or appears for a server error — that is the screen's own error state, and a guest told they are offline when the venue is down reconnects for nothing. Each screen's `states.offline` says what stays on screen and what waits.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale)

A guest finds something to do, picks when and how many, holds capacity, pays, and receives a ticket they can show at the gate, transfer or resell. The same booking engine serves the guest website (P01, WEB-), the guest app (P02, GST-) and, through the same catalogue, cart and order operations, the kiosk (P05), the cashier at the till (P04) and the staff handheld (P06); partners book on credit through the partner portal (P10). Guest surfaces are white-label (venue logo, colours, fonts, card layouts, step indicator style, cart placement) with "Powered by TICVAI" kept; the till and handheld stay TICVAI-branded. The booking runs in a fixed order that the client set on 29 September and confirmed on 30 September: for a dated product, the date first, then the time (hidden until a date), then the tickets (hidden until a time); undated products go straight to the tickets; product-first flows (workshops) pick the product, then the date; seated events with one performance open on the seat map, sections first, zoom into a section, pinch out to compare. Choosing a date, time or session commits nothing; capacity is held only when a quantity is set (a 15-minute basket window, 8 minutes for seats and cabanas, one extension). The guest counters (adult, child, senior, infant, person of determination) belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices, so a basket line is "<ticket> · <guest type> × <n>"; group and school products start from group ticket cards and a typed headcount (minus, plus, and +10 on the app), supervisors free. Help me choose filters the catalogue on the server (never a consent step) with Show everything; consent questions such as "Are you able to swim?" are asked once after the session is picked and never again where the page already asked. Sign-in or the six-digit guest code is asked when the guest leaves Add-ons (or at payment, per venue), only the fields the venue configured; after the code, only the T&Cs tick remains (W1). Payment creates the order first and treats an unknown outcome as "checking with your bank", never a second charge; tickets issue on payment, go to Apple or Google Wallet, and a dynamic-QR event's ticket lives in the app. The guest app is deliberately not a copy of the website (30 September): its structure is Home, Explore, Plan and Tickets tabs with a persistent Buy tickets button, item pages that propose the right product (a restaurant's meal combo that includes admission), ride videos that play with no loader, a visit planner that plans each day at one park from that park's rides, dining and shops only, and in-park walking navigation; the booking flow inside it is functionally identical to the web. Vocabulary in guest copy follows the glossary's recorded exceptions (Booking, Session, QR). source: [F01, F02, F03, F07, F49, F52, F55, F57, F58, F59, MoM 29 Sep 1 (W1-W12), MoM 29 Sep 2, MoM 29 Sep 3, MoM 30 Sep 4.4-4.8, CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP 1-6, CLIENT-RESPONSE-REV3-25SEP, REV3-1, REV3-2, REV3-3, REV3-4, REV3-26, DI-1086 …

### Food, Beverage & Retail

Food & beverage, retail, rentals, inventory and procurement across the till (P04), the kitchen display (P15), the staff app (P06), Venue Management (P08), the guest web and app (P01/P02), the kiosk (P05) and the CMS (P13). COUNTER SERVICE (F108): the cashier takes the order on the Food & Drink board from the outlet's menu in force (sections in the outlet's order, option groups attached to the item), sends it to the kitchen, and only then charges — send to kitchen, then charge, for every POS F&B order (R261, upheld against the v2 frame by POSV2-4). The kitchen ticket is on the rail while the card is in the guest's hand; an unpaid sent order is cancelled while ordered or accepted and voided with a reason after (R125(3), R091(5)); the guest gets an order number, and the customer-facing status board (numbers only) is the kitchen display's KIT-007, mirrored on the till's queue (POSV2-7). TABLE SERVICE (F29, F80, F94): a party is seated with its covers, orders across the visit, courses are fired by the pass (DI-333, DI-407), the bill is printed and settled at the end and split by amount, covers, category, item or seat (DI-106); the client's table statuses are Available → Ordered → Table closed → Reserved with no cleaning status (DI-336); moving and merging tables stay on the staff app until after r2 (POSV2-8). GUEST ORDERING (F11, F48): a guest inside the venue orders in the app or web for pickup or delivery to a seat or a scanned location (DI-288, DI-291); F&B and retail are optional licensed modules completed inside TICVAI (DI-505), kept simple (DI-1091); no food without an admission ticket (DI-292); table reservations and the waitlist do not go through the cart and a dining deposit is a venue option, off by default (DI-1048, DI-1049, R077). KITCHEN (P15, F83, F88): TICVAI's own display on commodity screens (19 September, replacing the 31 July "integration point only", DI-077); one kitchen ticket per preparation station from the outlet's routing rules with a fallback display (DI-323); a fired timer counts up and resets per course, not shown for quick service (DI-334); displays are assigned to stations and filter by course, with no station-load tile in r1 (R277). 86 takes an item off sale on every till and guest menu immediately (R110(c)); guests always see "Sold out", never a missing dish. RETAIL (F17, F34, F51): scan and sell through the same cart, charge and payment as tickets and food (DI-795), one cart, one receipt and one QR per guest (DI-293); system stock per venue gates the sale (DI-294); returns by receipt or order number only in r1 (R139(c)), refund to the original tender with a reason code and note (DI-796, DI-797); Shop & Drop is paid online and collected on the way out (R236), a merchandise reservation lasts to the end of the visit day (R169, R215). TILL MONEY (F32, F73, F74, F87): the float is counted by denomination with note images and typed quantities (DI-775, DI-776, R229) while the hardware checks itself (DI-778); the close is a …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `WEB-033` Shop

**Merchandise, browsable before you arrive.**

| Device and orientation | This is the guest website, responsive: 1440 desktop and 390 phone widths, in the venue's brand. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `listMerchandise` reads a population and nothing reads one of them; the detail is the row until a `get` exists |

| Opens with | `cartId` (session), `outletId` (deepLink) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared ticket, a forwarded confirmation … |
| Route | `/shop` |

**What the spec says about it.** Added 17 August for parity with GST-026. **Not on the wireframe board** — needs drawing. CF-93. **Buy-and-collect is paid online** (decided 28 September, audit R236): the cart is checked out and paid here (`checkoutCart`, `createPayment`) and payment creates the shop-and-drop; `reserveMerchandise` was removed from the web. The app's GST-026 still reserves in the venue, where the reservation expiry runs 15 minutes ahead to the close of the operating day (audit R215 (2)).

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Merchandise to browse before arriving, paid online and collected at the venue (or delivered). Block A. The 29 September build put the shop under At the venue with a choice of collection point (Collect at the gate, car park kiosk, home delivery) and a collection code after paying; use that as the pattern.

**Contract gap logged** (the fix needs an operation or field the contracts do not have yet; draw the corrected version and mark what waits on the contract, as the open change entry says)

- No browsable shop frame before arrival in the prototype; not on the wireframe board. (CHG-SGU-026)

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): "Outlet id" and "Category id" text fields, an "In stock only" toggle and a "Lookup merchandise" primary button (a barcode price check). (CHG-GST-003).

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The shop list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the shop untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No shop yet. Offers Add cart line (`addCartLine`); distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches the shop, category or search picked; the other products are still there. Names it and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **There is no permission to name — a guest holds none** (ADR-0025: `x-ticvai-permission` is what a staff caller must hold; a guest call resolves to the guest's own data). No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the … |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows.** What was already loaded stays on screen, marked with its age. Anything that spends money, holds capacity or changes the account waits for the connection, and its button says so rather than failing. |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `GST-026`: The app reserves in the venue; the web always pays online first (R236).
- Match `WEB-042`: Shop and drop in the venue uses the same collection code.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
items:
- name: Summit Peaks hoodie
  price: AED 149
  variants:
  - S
  - M
  - L
  - XL
- name: Plush falcon mascot
  price: AED 79
- name: Tee + cap combo
  price: AED 119
  was: AED 138
collectionCode: 4827 · Main Gate shop

No access here means one of two things, told apart by the response: not signed in, where the guest is offered sign-in and brought back to this screen, or a record that is not theirs, which says so without saying whose it is. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the …

#### Requirements it meets

24 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- **Open question.** Resources: meeting-room booking (headcount, duration, time slot, room, add-ons tea/coffee/snacks), modelled on House of Wisdom. Merchandise: browse, cart with add/remove quantity, pickup or doorstep delivery. F&B: outlet/menu browsing; collect at counter, curbside, doorstep or priority delivery. *(open · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough (Resources, Merchandise, F&B) · DI-690)*
- Decision (raised by Aishwarya): F&B and retail/merchandise online sale are optional back-office-enabled modules; where enabled, the whole purchase (browse, cart, checkout, pickup-at-venue or ship-to-guest) completes inside TICVAI — guests are never sent to download a separate app. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-505)*
- Retail items (e.g. a t-shirt plus a cap) can be combined into a combo package with bundle-level pricing, presented both on-site and online with product images and descriptions. *(client request · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.3 Pricing, Bundles & Promotions · DI-358)*

Also apply: 39 for all of P01, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

### `WEB-042` Retail & Shop and Drop

**Buy merchandise and collect it on the way out.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P01 Guest Web (web) |
| Module | Retail · wave 2 · needs the `retail` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #18207 (APP-WEB-WEB-042) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025) |
| Device and orientation | This is the guest website, responsive: 1440 desktop and 390 phone widths, in the venue's brand. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): `listMerchandise` reads a population and nothing reads one of them; the detail is the row until a `get` exists |
| Offline | **The offline banner shows, and lookup cannot run.** A drop reference already on screen stays visible so the guest can quote it at the collection point. Reserving merchandise needs the connection. |
| Opens with | `outletId` (deepLink), `cartId` (session) · cold entry: **A guest arriving cold on a link that no longer resolves is shown what happened and one way onward — never a 404.** A shared link, a scanned code and a … |
| Route | `/retail-and-shop-and-drop` |

**What the spec says about it.** **The web could sell merchandise and could not arrange collection.** `lookupShopAndDrop` was app-only, which made the service half-available on the surface most guests use. **Paid online at checkout** (decided 28 September, audit R236): the guest adds the item to the cart for collection, checks out and pays (`addCartLine`, `checkoutCart`, `createPayment`), and payment creates the shop-and-drop that `lookupShopAndDrop` then finds; `reserveMerchandise` ("reserved at purchase") is no longer wired here. **Paid only on the web (R236; DEC-075 of 2 October).** The app keeps an unpaid "hold to pay at the shop" drawn as secondary until decided, a sanctioned difference between the twins. The barcode price check (`lookupMerchandise`) is not drawn on the web (DEC-076) (CHG-SGU-018).

**From the Food, Beverage & Retail process.** Buy merchandise on the web, pay online at checkout, and collect it on the way out (shop and drop) or have it delivered home. Later, find what is waiting and where. Paying creates the shop-and-drop; nothing is reserved unpaid on the web (R236). The one thing to get right: before paying, the guest knows where and until when to collect. After paying, they get one collection code, and their ticket also claims the goods.

**Contract gap logged** (the fix needs an operation or field the contracts do not have yet; draw the corrected version and mark what waits on the contract, as the open change entry says)

- Nothing in the contract marks a cart line "for collection" or carries the chosen collection point. OrderLineAttributes defines only transport, and createShopAndDrop requires a collectionPointId. No operation lists the … (CHG-SGU-024)
- An item that cannot be dropped (chilled, fragile, oversized) is refused only when payment creates the drop, after the money is taken. (CHG-SGU-024)

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Plumbing on screen: "Outlet id" and "Category id" text boxes; an "Every merchandise" table with id, sku, barcode, variantId … (CHG-SGU-018); "Check out" and "Pay" (checkoutCart, createPayment) are buttons on the shop page, and the rev 3 prototype pays in one tap on the page. (CHG-SGU-018); lookupMerchandise (price check by barcode or SKU) is declared on the guest web shop. (CHG-SGU-018); GST-026 still offers "Hold to pay at the shop" (reserveMerchandise); WEB-042 removed it under R236. (CHG-SGU-018).

#### Decided on this screen

Answered questions: draw the decision, not the old default. Where a decision and the tables below differ, the decision wins.

- **Where can shop-and-drop be collected and what hours do the points keep? Who sets the list?** → Drawn default accepted: Draw the two points from the prototype (gate desk, car park kiosk) with their hours, plus home delivery. *(decided by Chinmay, 2026-10-02; DEC-074 / CHG-NOTE-004)*
- **Should the web and app offer an unpaid "hold to pay at the shop", or only paid shop and drop?** → Drawn default accepted: Paid only on the web (R236). The app's hold is drawn as secondary until decided. *(decided by Chinmay, 2026-10-02; DEC-075 / CHG-NOTE-004)*
- **Is "scan an item in the shop with your phone" wanted on the guest web?** → Drawn default accepted: Not drawn. *(decided by Chinmay, 2026-10-02; DEC-076 / CHG-NOTE-004)*

Errors to draw in the form: 403 The performance's on-sale waiting room is on and the request has no valid admission token (ADR-0066).; 409 No capacity, or the product is not sellable on this channel (`notSellableOnChannel`). (CartProblem); 422 The booked window is missing, not allowed or the wrong length for the variant (`windowRequired`, `windowNotAllowed`, `windowLengthMismatch`; rev 3 REV3-13), or … (CartProblem)

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Shop**: Optional, chosen by name ("Marina Bay retail store"), never typed as an id. Left empty, the screen browses every shop in the venue. Price and stock belong to the shop the item comes from. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#listMerchandise / F17 step 1 / DI-294)*
- **Category, search, in stock only**: Categories as named chips. Search covers name and description. "In stock only" is off by default, so sold-out items stay visible and marked. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#listMerchandise / contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#/components/schemas/GuestMerchandiseItem)*
- **How you get it**: One choice for the order, shown before paying. Collection points come with their hours ("Collect at the gate, main gate desk, open until 30 minutes after close"; "East car park kiosk, staff load the boot"). Or "Deliver to my home" with an address, and the shipping fee appears as soon as the address is entered, for the guest to accept before payment. *(source: R236 / DI-359 / DI-360 / F17 step 1)*
- **Quantity**: 1 and up, capped by what is available; the cart refuses beyond stock with a specific reason. *(source: contracts/spine/orders.yaml#addCartLine / DI-294)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Merchandise** (card list, from `listMerchandise`): The guest projection: name, photo, price and whether it can be bought; sold-out items stay visible. No sku, barcode, variant, stock or inventory ids.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | — |
| Description | text | — |
| Price | AED 1,234.50 | On the wire this is three fields; in the database it is one column. 24 August. |
| Is available | yes / no (icon or chip) | True when the item is active and in stock at its outlet. An item with no `inventoryItemId` never runs out, so it is available while active. |
| Image | the image or video | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add to basket (primary button) | `addCartLine` POST `/carts/{cartId}/lines` | AddCartLineRequest | Cart | 403 The performance's on-sale waiting room is on and the request has no valid admission token (ADR-0066).; 409 No capacity, or the product is not sellable on this channel (`notSellableOnChannel`). (CartProblem); 422 The … | opens modal first |
| What is waiting for me (secondary button) | `lookupShopAndDrop` GET `/shop-and-drop/lookup` | — | ShopAndDrop[] | 400 No identifier supplied | — |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Product cards**: Square photo, name, price, and "Sold out" when the item cannot be bought (still shown). A returnable item shows a small line "Returnable within 14 days". The guest never sees stock counts, SKUs or barcodes. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#/components/schemas/GuestMerchandiseItem / DI-1080)*
- **Basket**: Merchandise sits in the one shared cart with tickets and food (one checkout, one receipt). Each line says how it is collected ("Collect at the gate by 22:00"). *(source: DI-293 / contracts/spine/orders.yaml#checkoutCart)*
- **After payment**: A collection card: the drop reference large, with a QR; the collection point, "Collect by 22:00 today" and the items. The note "Your ticket also works, show it at the desk" follows, because the ticket claims the goods. Home delivery shows the delivery date instead. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#/components/schemas/ShopAndDrop / F51 step 2 / R236)*
- **Find my collection**: Every drop awaiting collection on one screen, even four bags from four shops. Each shows its point, its collect-by time and its status: Waiting, Partly collected, Collected, or Not collected. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#lookupShopAndDrop / F51 step 3)*

**What each action does** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Add to basket**: Adds to the shared cart and holds the stock for the 15-minute cart window. A refusal is specific (sold out at this shop, not sellable online). *(source: contracts/spine/orders.yaml#addCartLine / R169)*
- **Checkout**: Goes to the shared cart and checkout (WEB-010, WEB-012), not a pay button on this page. Payment creates the shop-and-drop. *(source: R236 / DI-293 / contracts/spine/orders.yaml#checkoutCart)*
- **Find my collection**: Looks up by the guest's ticket, the drop reference or the receipt number, whichever they still have. With nothing typed, a signed-in guest's own tickets are used. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#lookupShopAndDrop / F17 step 3)*

**Data it reads**: `listMerchandise` (onLoad, List merchandise)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `WEB-010` Shopping Cart: *Go to basket: one cart and one checkout for tickets, F&B add-ons and retail (DI-293, R236)*; carries `cartId`, `performanceId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Content resolves in place. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. **The rest of the site is unaffected.** |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Nothing here yet for this venue.** Names what turns it on rather than showing an empty panel. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Nothing matches. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **There is no permission to name: a guest holds none** (ADR-0025). The shop is public; buying needs the guest's cart. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **The offline banner shows, and lookup cannot run.** A drop reference already on screen stays visible so the guest can quote it at the collection point. Reserving merchandise needs the connection. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 No identifier supplied; 409 No capacity, or the product is not sellable on this channel (`notSellableOnChannel`). (CartProblem); 422 The booked window is missing, not allowed or the wrong length for the variant (`windowRequired`, `windowNotAllowed`, `windowLengthMismatch`; rev 3 REV3-13), or … (CartProblem) |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **The last one sells at a till while the guest is paying**: Checkout refuses that line by name and keeps the rest of the cart. Better here than at the counter. *(source: F51 step 2 / contracts/spine/orders.yaml#checkoutCart)*
- **An item cannot be dropped (chilled, fragile, oversized)**: Say so on the product card and offer only home delivery or "take it with you", before the item reaches the basket. See corrections. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#createShopAndDrop)*
- **The collection point closes before the collect-by time**: Offer another collection point before payment; never sell a drop that cannot be collected. *(source: contracts/satellite/retail.yaml#createShopAndDrop / F17 step 5)*
- **The guest leaves without collecting**: After the collect-by time the drop shows "Not collected" with the venue contact. The buying screen states the window up front. *(source: F51 step 3 / F17 step 5)*
- **The guest lost the reference**: Look up by ticket or receipt instead. *(source: F17 step 3)*
- **Offline**: Lookup cannot run. A reference already on screen stays visible to quote at the desk. *(source: screens/P01-guest-web-storefront.yaml#WEB-042)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `GST-026`: The buying half: functionally identical (DI-970), the same collection choices, wording and refusals.
- Match `GST-062`: The collecting half: the same collection card and lookup. On the web both halves are on WEB-042; in the app they are split.
- Match `WEB-033`: The web also has Shop (WEB-033), which F51 uses for browsing. The product cards and sold-out treatment must match, and the lead should decide whether WEB-033 and WEB-042 are one shop.
- Match `KSK-017`: Same product card and sold-out treatment.
- Match `WEB-010`: The cart line shows the collection choice.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
shop: Marina Bay retail store
items:
- name: Aqua Park tee, green, M

```

#### Permissions

- `listMerchandise` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest
- `addCartLine` → no permission · guest, partner, staff
- `lookupShopAndDrop` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest

**A refused user sees:** **There is no permission to name: a guest holds none** (ADR-0025). The shop is public; buying needs the guest's cart.

#### Requirements it meets

6 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Decision (raised by Aishwarya): F&B and retail/merchandise online sale are optional back-office-enabled modules; where enabled, the whole purchase (browse, cart, checkout, pickup-at-venue or ship-to-guest) completes inside TICVAI — guests are never sent to download a separate app. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-505)*
- Once a delivery address is entered, the applicable shipping fee is shown automatically for the customer to accept before payment. *(client request · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.8 Online Order Fulfilment & Shipping Configuration · DI-360)*
- Online retail offers buy-online-pickup-in-store and buy-online-ship-to-address. Shipping fees are set by region/city (e.g. Dubai, Abu Dhabi, international); decision: operations enter courier rates and margins manually, no live courier-API integration at this stage. *(agreed · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.3 Pricing, Bundles & Promotions; 4.8 Online Order Fulfilment & Shipping Configuration · DI-359)*
- F&B: browse outlets and order; pickup location shown automatically per outlet, with delivery as an extra option (needs guest location) when the venue uses the platform's F&B module. Retail follows the same pickup/delivery model. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.4 Venue Map, Queueing, F&B, Retail & Parking · DI-205)*

Also apply: 39 for all of P01, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (23), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (5 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#WEB-042?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Add to basket, What is waiting for me.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `WEB-010`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 4 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] The 6 edge case(s) from the process notes are drawn.
- [ ] The 3 decision(s) taken on this screen are drawn as decided, not as the old default.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

| Element | Configured in | Allowed values | Default | What it changes |

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Decided for every guest screen:** **No dark or light mode.** The venue's chosen theme applies on every device setting; `Theme.darkMode` is deprecated and ignored, never drawn, and the guest app has no Light/Dark switch (Chinmay, 2 October, Q150; CHG-CSA-035). ***Powered by TICVAI* is a tenant toggle, on by default** (`brand.showPoweredBy`): shown on the launch screen, at the foot of Account and in the web footer; switching it off needs the licence add-on, or 403 `powered-by-locked` (Chinmay, 2 October, Q160; DI-297; CHG-CSA-036). **Each homepage section sets its card count and its scroll animation** (`maxItems`; `scrollAnimation` rise, scale, slide, blur or none, default rise): every customisation option of the approved wireframe (Chinmay, 2 October, Q152 and Q153; DI-1088; CHG-CSA-040). **Landing-page templates.** A tenant with no landing page of its own starts from a TICVAI template (`listLandingPageTemplates`, kept as `HomepageLayout.templateKey`); one with its own site links in with deep links (`landingSource` ownSite) (Chinmay, 2 October, batch 2 #41; CHG-CSA-037).

**Never configurable:** A dark or light mode: the guest surfaces have one theme, the venue's (Chinmay, 2 October; CHG-CSA-035). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P01 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the website. Rev 3 with the 29 September fixes and the 30 September feedback (group booking with a headcount, multi-park counters, surf session tickets, the swim-ability answer, transport stations and departures, popular route cards; `CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP.md` beside it). The client approved it for development once W1 to W10 are in.
- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Visit Planner.dc.html`: the visit planner. WEB-050 Plan Your Visit is this file.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-026, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P01 Guest Web

- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- **Open question.** Real venue photos, clips and logos are still to come from the client; designs use stand-ins. Slots expected: a photo per ticket card and clip per card, a square shot per extra/shop item, one landscape poster per venue for the single-event page. Photos ≥1600 px, clips mp4 6–12 s, no audio. *(open · design review 29 Sep 2026, Asset list — TICVAI Guest Booking · DI-1080)*
- The tenant picks which logo lockup sits in the nav bar and a logo variant (Light, Dark, Duotone) whose colours drive the theme. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-4 · Brand logo + Logo palette (Light/Dark/Duotone) · DI-1068)*
- Theme settings: surface style Glass (default) or Solid cards; button style Solid (default), Outline or Pill. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-3 · Surfaces (Glass/Solid) and Buttons (Solid/Outline/Pill) · DI-1067)*
- Venue branding offers named palettes, font pairs, background tones and a 0–22 px corner radius. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-2 · Brand: Palette, Typeface; Shape: Background, Corner radius · DI-1066)*
- Guest-facing copy may say "session" (surf sessions, timed sessions) as a glossary exception, like "Booking". *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-10 · 'Sessions can be added, edited or closed from Config -> Sessions' · DI-1064)*
- Never ask the same thing twice: table zone is picked on the table map (no zone step before it); height is asked once (height bands on the water-park day pass are the eligibility check); party/school summaries prefill headcount, child's name and age from the earlier form. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 28 Sep 2026, Flow review (28 Sep): repeated steps removed · DI-1000)*
- Confirmed final: cart sliding in from the right or bottom, card size options, and cart-sidebar placement left or right; Qossai specifically liked the compact card size. No further changes requested. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.10 Guest Web App — Card Layout & Cart Configuration Confirmed · DI-991)*
- Headers are reserved for standard elements only (venue image, category tabs, language bar, profile icon), applied consistently; date/availability selection belongs in the main content below the header, never in the header. Header/layout patterns must be adapted for mobile, which looks and behaves differently. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.9 Guest Web App — Specific UX Feedback (Header/Date Placement Standardization) · DI-990)*
- A language button (EN / العربية) sits in the header next to the profile icon, web and mobile. Arabic flips the whole layout right-to-left and switches interface text (navigation, buttons, booking steps, ticket names and tags, cart, seat map, checkout, account). Venue, show and dish names stay as written. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 2. Language icon in the header · DI-975)*
- Replace "Sign in / Create account" in the header with a single profile icon. It opens one screen with Log in and Register tabs; signed-in guests get their account menu from the same icon. *(client request · design review 23 Sep 2026, Header 1. One profile icon in the header that opens login / register · DI-974)*
- Allam's model reference: a simple card-based family-entertainment-centre site with minimal clicks, a right-side cart drawer, "help me choose", clear categories, video that autoplays when a guest taps "read more", adapting seamlessly between desktop and mobile. Allam and Qossai want this simplicity to guide the guest experience. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.14 Guest Website UX Review — Upsell/Cross-Sell Placement & Reference Sites · DI-952)*
- **Open question.** Allam expects a large volume of feedback on the guest web/mobile prototype; detailed feedback goes to a separate dedicated session with Qossai and Allam. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-888)*
- The reviewed prototype is the actual guest-facing B2C site customers browse and book from, not a CMS tool. A separate, more limited white-label interface lets a client adjust colours, fonts and layout from a menu of options; not yet built in the prototype. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-887)*
- **Open question.** Product card-layout options shown in the prototype: stacked, staggered, horizontal. Choice/feedback pending the dedicated review. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-886)*
- **Open question.** Prototype's white-label panel previews the guest site under theme presets (e.g. "stadium", "theatre"), alternative layouts and brand colour palettes. Shown by Chinmay; client feedback deferred to a dedicated session. *(open · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-885)*
- Qossai is dissatisfied with the current B2C guest platform build and wants a separate vision session; references: the "Little Explorer" site and Six Flags. Six Flags cues: single-page flow. *(client request · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.20 Planning & Next Steps · DI-736)*
- Allam: most guests book from a smartphone, so the mobile version of the booking flows is the higher priority to validate (only desktop shown). *(client request · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.18 Guest Booking Flow Prototype Walkthrough · DI-684)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Configurable cookie consent banner (accept/reject) per website; some cookies flagged mandatory (non-rejectable), others optional; templated and configurable in the system. *(client request · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.13 Privacy Consent & Cookie Policy · DI-617)*
- Waiver versioning, a mobile-optimised guest waiver view, approval/testing/publication flow, and access to the form via a QR code that opens it directly. *(client request · MoM 31 Aug 2026, 4.9 Waiver / Consent Form Configuration · DI-575)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Six Flags Kidiya reference: fixed header with configurable navigation (logo, Explore/Tickets/Passes, sub-menus), every item toggleable via the CMS. *(client request · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review — Six Flags Kidiya Reference Walkthrough · DI-424)*
- Allam: the venue's main website is fully venue-managed; after "Book Now" the white-label B2C flow keeps the venue's header/footer branding while product selection, cart and checkout are TICVAI-managed. Header/footer links to non-checkout pages redirect to the main venue site. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-397)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- Qossai: present products with video rather than static images (as Talabat-style apps do); see benchmark app "222" for further inspiration. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.10 Bundle Packages · DI-222)*
- Qossai shared reference apps (Al Qadiya / Six Flags Saudi Arabia, and "The District" by Zomato) and cited their use of video over static images as design inspiration. *(client request · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 13. Mobile / POS App Design References · DI-146)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Base ticket-booking UX (web and mobile) on current market best practice rather than the demoed references as-is; Allam recommends the "Viva Ticket" website as a reference for the flow variations. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 10. Reference Material & Design Research · DI-125)*
- A multi-language toggle switches the entire site's content. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-120)*
- Allam: banner, header, footer and background color are CMS-configurable per client, but site structure and navigation flow are fixed and adapt automatically to product configuration (dated, non-dated, seated, membership products surface the right fields). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-119)*
- All sites are fully mobile-responsive; e.g. the desktop calendar view collapses into a mobile-optimized layout. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-113)*
- A "powered by [platform]" footer credit is fixed and not client-editable. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-111)*
- One client can run multiple branded sites from the same setup, e.g. two brands sharing a footer but with distinct headers and hero banners. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-110)*
- White-label sites share one platform/template but each is configured independently: header, footer, logo, colors, fonts and hero banner are client-editable from the backend. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-108)*
- Selling reference layout: clean top navigation; category tabs with counts (All Events 32, Exhibitions, Guided Tours ...); sort and type chips (Price, Rating, Popular; General, Seated, Multipass, Scheduled, Rental); content cards with large image, type badge, rating, tags (LIMITED, NEW, BESTSELLER), availability ("180 available", "11 left") and "from" price; persistent cart on the right with member discount, totals and "Checkout Securely". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, items 2-5 · DI-026)*
- Preliminary perceived-performance targets: web pages load in under about 3 seconds, mobile app loads in under about 2 seconds, ticket validation responds in under 500 milliseconds. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 18. Performance and Scalability · DI-015)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
