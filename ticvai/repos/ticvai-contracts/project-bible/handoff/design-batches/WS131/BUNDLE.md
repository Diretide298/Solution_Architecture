## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `APPROVAL_REQUEST, EVENT_CONFIGURE, PERFORMANCE_CONFIGURE, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it

WHAT THE PROCESS IS. Everything a guest can buy is set up, priced, promoted and serviced here, on Venue Management (P08, the venue's own back office, served inside the venue's cell) and on the TICVAI Console (P09, TICVAI's control plane, outside every cell). End to end: (1) CATALOGUE. A product has one of twelve kinds (admission, timedAdmission, datedAdmission, openDated, seated, membership, bundle, fnb, retail, rental, addOn, giftCard). Its ticket types (adult, child, senior, resident...) are not typed one by one: they are generated from the product's attributes (components) and each value combination becomes a sellable ticket type with no extra setup (DI-164). What a ticket grants (validity, entries, re-entry, days of week, blackout dates, expiry anchor, fast track, transfer) lives on a reusable entitlement template, not on the product. Who may take part (age, height, supervision, certification) is the eligibility rule; what the guest must answer is the data mask and the consent questions; how the guest sees it is guestListing (bookable, infoOnly, hidden), display tags (at most six), media and the booking flow. Group, family and corporate products and every after-sales policy (reschedule, exchange, refund, cancellation, upgrade, transfer) are configured inside the one product configuration, never on separate screens (DI-465, DI-466). (2) LIFECYCLE AND PUBLICATION. A product moves draft, inReview, approved, live, withdrawn, archived. Approval and publication are two acts with two permissions (PRODUCT_APPROVE, PRODUCT_PUBLISH, R091); every product is authorised before it sells online or on site (DI-438). Approved is still not on a till: a till sells only what is in the signed catalogue release it pulled (publishBundle, ADR-0013), so a saved price is a back-office fact until the venue publishes to tills. Changing something that has sold is preceded by an impact check (assessProductChange: orders affected, entitlements issued, future performances, open carts); restoring a version creates a new version, and sold tickets keep the price and terms they were sold under (restoreProductVersion, DI-938, TRACKER Actions row 145). (3) PRICE. Prices live in price lists: per venue, per channel set, with validity dates and a priority, copied for the next season with an uplift (copyPriceList) and repriced in bulk only after a dry run (bulkChangePrices). Currency and decimal scale are never chosen on a form: they resolve from the venue's region (ADR-0008, ADR-0018; AED 2 places, OMR and BHD 3). When several rules apply, the configured hierarchy decides; there is no "lowest price wins" default (DI-595). Tax on the pre-discount price and three-decimal rounding are regional settings (DI-598). Dynamic rules always show their minimum and maximum price guardrails beside the trigger (getDynamicPriceRule). (4) PROMOTE AND BUNDLE. A promotion is a rule (automatic, or gated by a code) created in draft, made live only by Publish, which first analyses stacking; a …

### Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management)

Platform Foundation is everything the apps stand on. Five apps each have one door: the guest app and website (WEB-016, GST-042: a six-digit code to email or mobile, a password, Apple or Google, UAE Pass; never enterprise SSO), the till (POS-000: employee number and PIN, recent operators as tiles; the kitchen display is the same app), the staff handheld and scanner (EMP-001, SCN-001), Venue Management (SUP-001, the single door for the back office P08, the CMS P13, analytics P16 and the support desk P12) and TICVAI Control (ADM-001 for TICVAI's own platform operators, PTR-001 for partner users; the developer portal P14 and the sign-up P17 belong to this app too). A second factor is required by permission, not by role or device: ROLE_MANAGE, LEDGER_APPROVE and every PLATFORM_* permission, plus any the tenant adds; so a cashier never sees it and a platform operator always does. The factor is an authenticator app with an emailed code as fallback; five wrong codes lock step-up for the lockout minutes, never permanently. Guests get two-step verification only at a venue that switched it on. One person holds one session per workstation: a second sign-in is refused and only a supervisor ends the other session. Several roles mean a role prompt; one role goes straight in. The workstation decides the Sale Board, hardware and till identity, never what a person may do. Sensitive actions (refund approval, journal approval, credential reset, partner credit, commission rules, opening a platform-staff grant and 17 more) demand a fresh step-up on the operation itself, asked in place in the action's confirmation; the tenant may raise the strength, never remove it. Permission outcomes are three, never one word: self-authorised (proceeds, audited), escalated (a supervisor PIN in place), refused (the denied state, naming the permission); a missing permission is never an empty table, and a record outside the person's venues is "not found", indistinguishable from absent. The hierarchy is binding (tenant, brand, region, venue, department, sub-department, workstation; outlet beside department for F&B and retail); region owns currency, decimals, time zone, date format and fiscal year; configuration resolves nearest-ancestor across tenant, region and venue (outlet for F&B and retail), venue is the floor and a workstation is assigned a profile, never configured; every configuration screen says which level it writes and what it inherits. Venue Management is one tenant-level surface filtering across the venues in the session's scope. TICVAI's Console runs outside every cell: a platform operator picks a tenant and opens a time-boxed, audited platform-staff grant (with step-up) before any tenant action, and the tenant sees every action in its audit log (ADM-412 is the reference implementation). Approval workflows record authorisations and never perform the action; the requester cannot approve their own request; a venue may tighten and never loosen a rule from above; in-flight …

| Workstation (back office) / till (operator copy) | A configured device; decides Sale Board, hardware and till identity, never authorisation. | Terminal, Station, POS (for the device), till (for the Deposit Box) | ADR-0002; R156 |
| Sale Board | The configured front end a workstation loads (ticketing, F&B or retail). | Screen, Layout, Menu | ADR-0003 |
| Role | A named, fully configurable grouping of permissions; the seeded five are editable starting points. | Group, Profile | R229 |
| Staff member / Partner user / Platform operator | A tenant's staff principal; a partner's user; a TICVAI employee in the Console. | User (alone), Account, Agent (for venue staff) | F104 step 1; F104 step 4; F104 step 5 |
| Platform-staff grant | The time-boxed, audited access a platform operator opens into one tenant before acting in it. | Impersonation, Support login | R098 |
| Escalate / Refused | Escalate is supervisor approval captured in place; Refused is the denied state that names the permission. | Denied (for an action that can be escalated) | R197 |
| Approve / Reject / Return / Request information | The four decisions on an approval request; Withdraw is the requester's own act and never a rejection. | Accept, Decline, Cancel (for withdraw) | contracts/spine/approvals.yaml#decideApprovalRequest … |

| Membership / Annual pass | A guest's pass product and its holder (BO-284 to BO-303). | Subscription (that is the tenant's TICVAI plan) | screens/P08-venue-back-office.yaml#BO-284 |
| Sandbox client / Production client | A developer's own test credential; a TICVAI-issued live credential after certification. | Test key, Live key, API key (without environment) | DI-927 |
| Asset (DAM) / Media (ticket) | A digital file in the library; ticket media is a wristband or card carrying entitlements. Never mix them. | Media (for a library asset) | contracts/satellite/assets.yaml#searchMedia … |


## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BO-716` | Event Lifecycle & Change Command Center | A | 6 | 5 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | notStarted (—) |
| `BO-717` | Lifecycle Transition Configuration | B | 0 | 9 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | notStarted (—) |

| `BO-720` | Ticket, Reservation & Customer Treatment Configuration | B | 0 | 13 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | notStarted (—) |

## Thin screens in this batch

**BO-717, BO-718, BO-719, BO-720 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `BO-716` Event Lifecycle & Change Command Center

**See where an event is in its lifecycle and move it to its next state under change control.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Sell · wave 1 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block A · task APP-SETUP-BO-716 |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `EVENT_CONFIGURE`, `PRODUCT_VIEW` (1 configure, 1 read); in the flows as venue manager |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | detail (compact density): One event's lifecycle state with the change to its next state beside it (defined 4 October 2026 from setEventLifecycleState, CHG-FXS-001). |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `eventId` (navigation) |
| Route | `/sell/event-lifecycle-change-command-center-bo-716` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Defined 4 October 2026: the current state is Event.lifecycleState (readOnly, agreed with contracts in the ledger; setEventLifecycleState's 200 has no body, so the screen reads the event again), the target state, reason and effective date are the call's body** (CHG-FXS-001)

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process.** Moves an event through its lifecycle (draft, planned, on sale, live, closed, cancelled) and shows why a transition is not yet possible: going on sale needs a price, a capacity and a schedule; going live a resource plan; cancelling a treatment for everyone who bought. Changes above a configured impact go to approval.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The purpose describes a consolidated financial, sponsorship and attendance view of events, not lifecycle and change control. (CHG-WIR-026); No read operation: the screen declares only setEventLifecycleState and nothing that returns the current configuration. (CHG-WIR-025).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Move to | select | optional | — | Draft · Planned · On sale · Live · Closed · Cancelled · Archived | — | Draft, planned, on sale, live, closed, cancelled, archived; only the next states the current one allows. On sale needs a price, a capacity and a schedule; live needs a resource plan; cancelled needs … | `Event.lifecycleState` |
| Reason | text field | — | — | — | — | Body reason; required for cancelled. | — |
| Effective from | date picker | — | — | — | — | Body effectiveFrom; now by default. | — |

**Sent by *Save event lifecycle state*** (`setEventLifecycleState`; no form is declared, so these are filled from the screen or collected inline)

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| State `state` | select | required | — | Draft · Planned · On sale · Live · Closed · Cancelled · Archived | — | — | `setEventLifecycleState` body |
| Reason `reason` | text area | optional | — | — | — | — | `setEventLifecycleState` body |
| Effective from `effectiveFrom` | date and time picker | optional | — | — | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | — | `setEventLifecycleState` body |

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Event** (detail panel, from `getEvent`): lifecycleState is readOnly on Event (agreed with contracts in the ledger).

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | — |
| Code | text | — |
| Lifecycle state | chip: Draft, Planned, On sale, Live, Closed, Cancelled… | Where the event is in its lifecycle (4 October 2026, CHG-FXC-003; catalogue.event had nowhere to keep it). |
| Performance count | 1,234 | How many performances the event has. Counted by the server; never sent by a client. |
| Is active | yes / no (icon or chip) | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Save event lifecycle state (primary button) | `setEventLifecycleState` POST `/events/{eventId}/lifecycle` | inline | no body | 409 Preconditions for the transition are not met; they are listed | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

**What each action does** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Transition**: The button for the next state lists its preconditions as a checklist, unmet ones linked to where they are fixed; cancel asks for the treatment (refund, reschedule, credit) and shows how many guests are affected. *(source: contracts/spine/catalogue.yaml#setEventLifecycleState / F09 step 2)*

**Data it reads**: `getEvent` (onLoad, Read an event)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-100` Venue Home: *Back to Venue Home*
- → `BO-717` Lifecycle Transition Configuration: *Lifecycle Transition Configuration*; carries `eventId`
- → `BO-718` Event Change Request Configuration: *Event Change Request Configuration*
- → `BO-719` Event Cancellation Workflow Configuration: *Event Cancellation Workflow Configuration*; carries `eventId`
- → `BO-720` Ticket, Reservation & Customer Treatment Configuration: *Ticket, Reservation & Customer Treatment Configuration*; carries `eventId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The event and its state. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load the event. Names it; nothing changes. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | Not used: the screen opens on one event (eventId). |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the event lifecycle change are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `PRODUCT_VIEW`, which `getEvent` requires to show this screen, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. A caller who can see the screen but lacks what an action needs sees that action disabled, naming its permission: `EVENT_CONFIGURE` for `setEventLifecycleState`. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 Preconditions for the transition are not met; they are listed |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Change above the approval threshold (for example moving a sold-out performance)**: Submitted for approval rather than applied; the event shows "Awaiting approval" with the approver. *(source: contracts/spine/catalogue.yaml#setEventLifecycleState)*

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
event:
  name: Dune Nights Festival 2026
  state: On sale
  next: Live
  missing:
  - Resource plan for 14 Nov

### `BO-717` Lifecycle Transition Configuration

**Move an event between lifecycle states, with the checks each transition requires.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Sell · wave 3 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block B · task VM-BO-717 |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `EVENT_CONFIGURE`, `PRODUCT_VIEW` (1 configure, 1 read); in the flows as venue manager |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): **nothing in the pack chooses a pattern for this screen** — no metric directory, no display directory, no configuration directory. It falls to the default, and the fallback is recorded rather than … |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `eventId` (navigation) |
| Route | `/sell/lifecycle-transition-configuration-bo-717` |

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process.** The rules an event's lifecycle follows: what each transition requires (price, capacity and schedule to go on sale; resource plan to go live; a ticket treatment to cancel) and which changes go to approval.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): No read operation: the screen declares only setEventLifecycleState and nothing that returns the current configuration. (CHG-WIR-025); The purpose text is shared word for word with BO-701, BO-704, BO-711, BO-721 and does not describe this screen (Lifecycle Transition … (CHG-WIR-026).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Read an event** (detail panel, from `getEvent`)

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ID | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Code | text | — |
| Name | text | — |
| Venue | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Parent event | the name it points at, never the id | For grouped events. |
| Performance count | 1,234 | How many performances the event has. Counted by the server; never sent by a client. |
| Is active | yes / no (icon or chip) | — |
| Lifecycle state | chip: Draft, Planned, On sale, Live, Closed, Cancelled… | Where the event is in its lifecycle (4 October 2026, CHG-FXC-003; catalogue.event had nowhere to keep it). |
| Lifecycle state changed at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Save event lifecycle state (primary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **transition checklist**: Each state change with its preconditions as a checklist and the approval threshold. *(source: contracts/spine/catalogue.yaml#setEventLifecycleState)*

**Data it reads**: `getEvent` (onLoad, Read an event)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-716` Event Lifecycle & Change Command Center: *Back to Event Lifecycle & Change Command Center*; carries `eventId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The lifecycle transition list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the lifecycle transition untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No lifecycle transition yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the lifecycle transition are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 Preconditions for the transition are not met; they are listed |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `BO-716`: Same states and preconditions as the lifecycle command centre.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
transitions:
- from: planned
  to: on sale
  needs:
  - price list
  - capacity
  - schedule
```

#### Permissions

- `setEventLifecycleState` → `EVENT_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff
- `getEvent` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

### `BO-718` Event Change Request Configuration

**Raise a change request against an event and send it for approval.**

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management) process.** Configure which event changes need approval and how a change request is raised.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Purpose is about measuring event financial performance. (CHG-WIR-023).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create approval request (primary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-716` Event Lifecycle & Change Command Center: *Back to Event Lifecycle & Change Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The event change request list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the event change request untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No event change request yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the event change request are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 An open request already exists for this subject. Two approvals for one refund is how a refund gets paid twice. (ApprovalStateProblem) |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **A person whose grants cover only some venues, or a link to a record in another venue**: The venue filter lists only venues in the session's scope (Session.scope, resolved at sign-in); a record outside it renders Not found, deliberately indistinguishable from absent, never a 'you may not see venue X' message. *(source: ADR-0011; contracts/shared/common.yaml#/components/schemas/Problem; contracts/spine/identity.yaml#getCurrentSession)*
- **createApprovalRequest answers 409**: Show it as something the person can act on, not a failure: An open request already exists for this subject. Two approvals for one refund is how a refund gets paid twice. `refusedReason` is `openRequestExists` and `requestId` names the open request, so the caller can point at it rather than raise another. A draft is not an open request. *(source: contracts/spine/approvals.yaml#createApprovalRequest)*

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
change: Move performance from 19:00 to 20:30
requiresApproval: true
approver: Venue Manager
affectedTickets: 412
```

#### Permissions

- `createApprovalRequest` → `APPROVAL_REQUEST` (operate) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

5 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

```yaml
defaults:
  moveTime: moveAutomatically
  moveDate: offerChoice
  cancel: refund
```

#### Permissions

- `rescheduleEvent` → `PERFORMANCE_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff
- `getEvent` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 4 for P08 · Sell, 24 for all of P08, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P08 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/5-venue-management/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html`: the client-approved POS, for operator density and components.
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html`: for finish and motion.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-030, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-041, DI-042, DI-043, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051, DI-052 (each is in the design inputs below).

**Workshop tracker rows about P08 as a whole** (1: 1 open, 0 closed). Open first; a closed row says where it went on 30 September.

- **S8** Venue Management back-end configuration wireframes *(Chinmay Parab · In progress · due Fri 2 Oct · 30 Sep 2026 · 30 Sep tracker)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P08 Venue Management

- Qossai: configuration screens should consolidate related functionality, potentially merging 3-4 previously separate screens into one, rather than the repetitive one-screen-per-concept pattern of the AI-built reference system. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.5 Screen Consolidation Philosophy · DI-987)*
- **Open question.** Open: should AI monitoring live in one centralised AI command dashboard or be distributed as widgets in each functional module's own dashboard? Allam: Softlabs' call; the current proposal is illustrative and Softlabs may propose a better structure. *(open · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.4 AI Governance — Risk, Compliance & Continuous Monitoring · DI-936)*
- Simulation functionality stays embedded within each relevant configuration section rather than being consolidated, since it tests that section's own configuration. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-722)*
- Client boards (POS Frontline, F&B, Retail, Inventory & Procurement) share one architecture: six boards of ten screens per domain, a command centre first and an AI/analytics board last, under the hierarchy Company > Venue > Department > Workstation > Operator/Shift > Transaction > Exception > Reconciliation > Analytics. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Opening / What the boards give us · DI-400)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- **Open question.** Allam: a user's visibility must be restrictable to specific outlets (an F&B manager of one outlet should not see other outlets' items); also relevant for ticketing/event-specific access. Implementation approach still open. *(open · MoM 18 Aug 2026, 4.6 Role-Based & Outlet-Level Access Control — Open Item · DI-331)*
- Access loads automatically at login on POS and web/admin. A user with one role logs straight in; a user with several roles (e.g. admin, cashier, supervisor, manager) is prompted to choose which role to use. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 4. Multiple Roles per User and Role Switching · DI-249)*
- Back office is role-driven from any device: a finance user signing in from a workstation, laptop or home sees only finance reports and related information. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 3. Role-Based Access and Workstation-Linked Front-End · DI-248)*
- Built-in help menu with step-by-step tutorials with screenshots for common tasks (e.g. how to sell a ticket at the POS). *(client request · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 8. Legacy POS Layout Designer & System Logging · DI-160)*
- Custom data-capture fields ("data mask") at account, event, extended-ticket and product level: field types text, dropdown, radio, true/false; multi-language labels; validation (min/max length, required/optional); reusable value lists (e.g. country list). Standard fields come out of the box. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 6. Data Mask: Flexible Custom Data Capture · DI-155)*
- Load/traffic dashboards respect the tenancy model: a venue manager sees traffic for their own venue only. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-061)*
- Allam: queue management is built into the system (not third-party) so traffic entering the site can be throttled from the back office itself. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-060)*
- **Open question.** Proposed tenant hierarchy Tenant > Organization/Brand > Region > Branch > Venue > Department, under review against TICVAI's own organisational hierarchy before finalising. *(open · MoM 30 Jul 2026, 2. Proposed Multi-Tenant Hierarchy · DI-055)*
- Documentation deliverable includes user guides and help content; the preview shows a TICVAI Help Center with categories (Getting Started, Events, Tickets, Orders, Payments, Memberships, Access Control, Reports, Integrations), a "Welcome to TICVAI" getting-started article and Quick Links (Create an Event, Set Pricing, Manage Access, View Reports). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - What We Deliver / Key Deliverables Preview · DI-052)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- AI Assistant panel: a short framing ("Based on last 30 days, here are 3 actions that can improve your revenue") then actionable recommendations, each with its potential impact (e.g. "Increase pricing for VIP seats, +12%") and a chevron, plus "View all recommendations". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - AI Panels · DI-043)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Back-office shell: collapsible left sidebar with Overview, Events, Tickets, Orders, Customers, Memberships, Access Control, POS, Reports, Analytics, AI Assistant, Settings, and the signed-in user (name, role) at the bottom; top bar with global search (Cmd+K), current time and date, Notifications with unread dot, and user menu. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 04 Dashboard Vision (p4) - navigation shell · DI-030)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*
- Reports and historical searches must still retrieve archived transactions when required; the retention period (e.g. keep 3 of 5+ years live) is configurable per customer, archival manual or automated. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 23. Database Optimisation and Archiving · DI-018)*
- Back-office controls for the waiting room: configurable maximum active users and admission intervals, set per customer and venue. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 19. Auto-scaling and Virtual Waiting Room · DI-017)*

### In P08 · Sell

- Allam: back-end configuration is the most critical part; the screens must make visually clear how administrators configure products, pricing per channel, attributes/components, entitlements, validity and access permissions, comparable to the structured product/metric-sheet approach of an earlier reference system. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.3 Back-End Configuration Detail — Requested Format (Screens, Not Just Functional Lists) · DI-985)*
- Chinmay: reduce the number of configuration screens/pages and consolidate related settings/toggles to avoid a long, click-heavy admin flow; Allam agreed, citing the previous system's demo as a starting reference. *(agreed · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.11 UX Simplification & Distributed Inventory · DI-474)*
- Retail dashboard gives a consolidated real-time view across outlets — total retail sales, total and average transactions, store performance snapshot, system alerts and out-of-stock indicators — viewable by day, week or month. *(client request · MoM 19 Aug 2026, 4.1 Retail Command Center — Dashboard & Store Setup · DI-349)*
- Allam/Qossai: the workstation/till/POS wireframes are reference only (partly ChatGPT-generated, with errors) and not to be replicated; Softlabs may consolidate dashboards freely and must cross-check the functionality matrix for missing items. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 11. Wireframe Walkthrough — Workstation, Till & POS Management · DI-312)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```json
{
"createApprovalRequest": {"method":"POST","path":"/approval-requests","contract":"approvals","summary":"Raise a request","permission":"APPROVAL_REQUEST","offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"venue","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":"CreateApprovalRequest","responds":"ApprovalRequest"},
"getEvent": {"method":"GET","path":"/events/{eventId}","contract":"catalogue","summary":"Read an event","permission":"PRODUCT_VIEW","offlineCapable":false,"conflictPolicy":"serverWins","scopeLevel":"venue","parameters":[],"requestBody":null,"responds":"Event"},
"rescheduleEvent": {"method":"POST","path":"/events/{eventId}/reschedule","contract":"catalogue","summary":"Move or cancel, and decide what happens to the people who bought","permission":"PERFORMANCE_CONFIGURE","offlineCapable":null,"conflictPolicy":null,"scopeLevel":"venue","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":"EventReschedule","responds":null},
"setEventLifecycleState": {"method":"POST","path":"/events/{eventId}/lifecycle","contract":"catalogue","summary":"Draft, planned, on sale, live, closed, cancelled","permission":"EVENT_CONFIGURE","offlineCapable":null,"conflictPolicy":null,"scopeLevel":"venue","parameters":[{"name":null,"in":null,"required":null}],"requestBody":null,"responds":null}
}
```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.

```json
{
"ApprovalDecision": {"type":"object","x-ticvai-persistence":"approvals.decision","required":["level","principalId","decision","decidedAt"],"properties":{"id":{"type":"string","format":"uuid","readOnly":true,"description":"**Added 20 August.** The schema reference derives table columns from API response schemas, and a response is not a table — this one returned everything a caller needs and not the row's own identity, so the table had no key and no row could be addressed, updated or deleted.

"ApprovalKind": {"type":"string","description":"11.1.7 and 11.1.30–11.1.37. **The first four already exist as bespoke implementations** and this contract is what they collapse into.\n**Which actions route here — decided 28 September, audit R144.** Finance and procurement acts go through this engine to a **finance approver**: closing a fiscal period (`periodClose`), reopening one (`periodReopen`), cancelling a purchase order (`purchaseOrderCancel`) and closing one short (`purchaseOrderShortClose`). The tenant default matrix for each of these names the finance approver role; a venue may tighten it and never loosen it. Starting a release rollout routes through `releasePromotion` to the platform release manager (a holder of `PLATFORM_RELEASE_PROMOTE`). **Not every `requiresApproval` goes here:** reopening a shift, recounting a stock count and a retail return above the venue threshold take a supervisor's step-up on the same device instead, and never raise a request.\n**Catalogue change requests route through `productChange` and `pricingChange`** (decided 29 September, writers pass): a product change and a price or pricing change raised in `catalogue` ask for approval under these two kinds, so a venue can route product edits and price edits to different approvers.\n\n**Optional review steps a venue switches on, decided 2 October 2026** (Chinmay; CHG-CSP-036, CHG-CSP-028, CHG-CSP-031). Each is an existing kind narrowed by the rule's `subjectTypes`, so no kind is added (a new value here would be a breaking change against r1) and each is off until the venue saves an active matrix for it:\n- **A purchase order** (`requisition`, subject `purchaseOrder`; Chinmay, 3 October 2026, Block A business rules; CHG-RUL-004): the PO approval matrix. Blanket and RFQ-award orders are raised without a requisition and are approved here instead; `inventory.createPurchaseOrder` asks for every order, by kind and value. - **Publishing white-label content** (`configurationChange`, subject `whiteLabelPublication`): simulate, then a single publish by a holder of the permission; a review step only where the venue sets one up (batch 1, CMS-014; DEC-156). - **Recording F&B waste above a value** (`stockWriteOff`, subject `fnbWaste`): the venue's waste-approval policy, value bands as `minAmount` and `maxAmount`, photo evidence above a value held by fnb (batch 6 #192, BO-139; DEC-192; R144). - **Publishing an access topology** (`configurationChange`, subject `topologyPublication`): second-person approval when the venue switches it on (batch 6 #230, BO-153; DEC-230). - **A permanent identity lock, a whitelist entry, or releasing a full-identity or permanent lock** (`accessPermissionChange`, subjects `identityLock`, `whitelistEntry`, `identityLockRelease`): always a second approver, never for an until-end-of-day lock (critical set 1, BO-229 and BO-247; DEC-254, DEC-260); the tenant default matrix names the security approver role and a venue may tighten it, never remove it.\n\n**A rota shift swap** (4 October 2026, CHG-FXC-008; Sprint 1-2 judging: `workforce.requestShiftSwap` raised a request\nwith no kind that fits). `configurationChange`, subject `shiftSwap`, `subjectContract` `workforce`, `subjectId` the\nShiftSwap id: an existing kind narrowed by `subjectTypes`, as the optional review steps above, so no kind is added.","enum":["refund","priceOverride","discountOverride","complimentaryTicket","membershipCancellation","accessPermissionChange","configurationChange","aiRecommendation","releasePromotion","requisition","stockWriteOff","journalEntry","periodClose","periodReopen","purchaseOrderCancel","purchaseOrderShortClose","tenantMigration","productChange","pricingChange"]},
