## Who this is for

**guest on kiosk.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 2 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### AI & Intelligence

AI in TICVAI is one governed engine behind many screens. The guest meets it as Sahli, the concierge (WEB-044, GST-031, GST-033), as the planner agent that refines a rules-built day plan by chat (GST-054), and as upsell and cross-sell offers on a separate Extras step (WEB-008, GST-048). Staff meet it as the Staff App's AI tab (EMP-019/020, knowledge EMP-040/041), the kiosk assistant (KSK-015) and the support copilot (SUP-006, SUP-018). Venue managers meet it in Venue Management (BO-091 policy and spend, BO-919/BO-925..932 resource and staffing forecasts, BO-597/598 configuration drafts, BO-772/782 marketing optimisation, BO-793 translations, BO-970/975 seat-map generation, BO-1048 seat upsell, BO-1160 fraud cases) and in Analytics (ANL-010 suggestions, ANL-019 management insights, ANL-055 anomalies, ANL-057 forecasting studio, ANL-059 insight history, ANL-060 governance, ANL-071 AI maturity). The governance, configuration-assistant, forecasting, oversight, audit and monitoring boards sit on the TICVAI Console (P09: ADM-037 providers, ADM-469..498 configuration assistant, ADM-499..518 forecasting, ADM-519..558 governance, ADM-633/637 fraud, ADM-680..697 recommendation governance). Five rules hold on every one of these screens. (1) Baseline first, then it learns per tenant: every data-driven answer (forecast, suggestion, risk score, recommendation) exists from day one, from the venue AI profile, a starting pattern for the venue type, the UAE calendar and the weather, and shifts to the venue's own data as it trades; nothing says "comes later" or refuses for lack of history - a refusal only names a missing setting. (2) Every answer shows its basis and maturity: a "Based on" line, a stage badge (Starting, Learning, Established, Trained on your data), "Limited historical data" while the starting pattern carries more than half the weight, ranges or bands rather than a bare percentage, a confidence only where the producer really has one, a plain-words explanation always. (3) A trained model replaces the baseline only when it beats it in a shadow run of at least six weeks and an admin promotes it; the platform raises "Ready to promote" and never switches by itself. (4) The LLM never reads raw data: numbers come only from query results the platform runs (the answer shows the query), only the masked prompt and retrieved context leave the platform, and AI only drafts - the owning screen applies. (5) One autonomy scale, L0 Disabled to L4 Controlled auto, with first-release ceilings, separate from user permission and from the approval tier; impactful actions route to a person, who sees current against proposed, impact, risk and what is affected, and can approve within a limit, challenge, override or roll back; every decision is traceable (data, model, approver, time) and searchable by customer, venue and capability. In Block A (5 October to 20 November 2026) the guest concierge with retrieval, Help me choose, translations, the planner agent, the gateway and …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `KSK-015` | Assistant | B–D | 3 | 37 | 5 | 35 | 0 | 0 | guest | notStarted (generated) |

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `KSK-015` Assistant

**Help a guest choose and pay, and nothing else.**

| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |

**What the spec says about it.** Added 17 August for 2.1.28, which names the kiosk explicitly and was the only surface with no AI screen. **Scoped to `guestCapabilityScope`** — ticket selection, promotions, FAQs, recommendations and checkout, and nothing else. **No keyboard**: voice or a constrained touch interface, which is why the app chat pattern does not transfer. Depends on CF-14. **Not on the wireframe board.** **Wave 2 with the rest of the kiosk.** Set to Wave 1 in error on 17 August — an assistant that guides a guest through ticket selection and checkout cannot ship before the screens that do the selecting and the checking out. **Cross-platform navigation removed 24 August**: SUP-004. **A till does not navigate to a back office and a guest app does not navigate to either** — those are device handovers, and a flow declares them with `crossesDevice` rather than a screen pretending there is a link.

**Known gaps.** **`getAvailability` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Sahli at the kiosk: helps a guest choose tickets and pay, and nothing else. There is no keyboard, so it is a constrained touch conversation - tap-to-answer chips ("How many adults?", "Today or another day?") leading to product cards and checkout - not a chat box. The one thing to get right: every path ends in a product the guest can add, or in calling a member of staff; the guest is never stuck in a conversation at a kiosk.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The layout is a staff product table (listProducts with id, scopePath, createdByPrincipalId, approvedByPrincipalId columns) and filter … (CHG-SGU-016); emptyNoAccess names PRODUCT_VIEW; emptyFirstRun says "Offers no create action". (CHG-GST-004); createAiConversation is not declared though sendAiMessage needs a conversation. (CHG-SGU-016); requiresModule is ticketing and the coldEntry speaks of "an agent opening a link from a notification". (CHG-SGU-016).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Form: Talk to a person** (confirmDialog, opened by *Talk to a person*; *Ask a person* calls `handoverToAgent`, *Keep asking* sends nothing)

Ask a person to help? The conversation so far goes with it (reason guestRequested, Sahli's own summary); the guest types nothing.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reason `reason` | select | required | — | Guest requested · Assistant refused · Assistant failed · Out of scope · Negative sentiment · Complex intent · Payment issue | — | — | `handoverToAgent` body |
| Summary `summary` | text field | optional | — | — | — | The assistant's own summary of what the guest wants, so the agent opens with context rather than reading a transcript while somebody waits. | `handoverToAgent` body |
| Preferred queue `preferredQueueId` | picker: choose a preferred queue | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | — | `handoverToAgent` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 409 No agent available. Returns the reason and offers a case, rather than queuing a guest for somebody who is not there. (HandoverRefusedProblem)

**Rules for these inputs** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **guest choices**: Large tap targets only (party size steppers, date chips, interest chips); free text only through an on-screen keyboard behind "Type a question", never first. Arabic and English toggle stays visible. *(source: screens/P05-guest-kiosk.yaml#KSK-015 (notes - no keyboard) / contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#/components/schemas/AiPolicy (guestCapabilityScope))*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Ask for help** (assistant panel, from `sendAiMessage`): Voice or a constrained touch interface, no keyboard. Products appear as cards inside the conversation (from `listProducts`, guest projection: name, price, what it includes), never as a table or a venue-id filter; tapping one returns the guest to the ticket step.

Returns the reason and offers a case, rather than queuing a guest for somebody who is not there. (HandoverRefusedProblem) | opens confirmDialog first |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **answer**: Short answers with product cards (name, price, availability for the chosen time) the guest adds with one tap; no citation row on a kiosk, but a policy answer names its policy ("Refund policy"). *(source: contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#sendAiMessage / contracts/spine/catalogue.yaml#getAvailability)*
- **availability**: Remaining capacity is display only and may be stale; the sale is decided at checkout. *(source: contracts/spine/catalogue.yaml#getAvailability)*

**What each action does** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Call staff (hand over)**: One big button always visible; hands over with reason guestRequested and Sahli's summary, and shows "A team member is on the way" or, with 409, "Please visit the ticket desk". *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#handoverToAgent / F24 step 2)*

#### States

| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the assistant untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | The ask prompt with three starter questions (tickets, timings, what is included). |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 A `categoryId` that names no category of the venue, or a `guidedAnswerIds` entry that is not an answer of the venue's published guided choice (W4, 29 …; 400 Validation failed; 409 No agent available. Returns the reason and offers a case, rather than queuing a guest for somebody who is not there. (HandoverRefusedProblem); 422 The guard model blocked the message or the reply (`guard-refused` … |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Question outside ticket selection, promotions, FAQs, recommendations and checkout**: Polite refusal and Call staff (reason outOfScope). *(source: F24 step 2 / screens/P05-guest-kiosk.yaml#KSK-015 (notes))*
- **Guest walks away mid-conversation**: The kiosk's idle timeout clears the conversation and the cart; nothing of the previous guest stays on screen. *(source: designer default)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `GST-031`: Same Sahli identity and wording; different input model (touch chips).

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
flow:
- Who is visiting? 2 adults, 1 child
- When? Today
- 'Sahli: The Family Day Pass is AED 540.00 for 2 adults and 2 children - for 2 adults and 1 child the Day Pass
  totals AED 450.00'
- Add to basket
```

#### Permissions

- `sendAiMessage` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff, guest
- `listProducts` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner
- `getAvailability` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner
- `handoverToAgent` → no permission · guest
- `recordAnswerFeedback` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff, guest
- `createAiConversation` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff, guest

**A refused user sees:** **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission.

#### Requirements it meets

35 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

- Client design-board frames: `Kiosk Board 2.dc.html#KSK-015`
- Flow F24 *A guest asks the assistant and ends up with a person*, step 1: Asks a question → Answered where it is inside `guestCapabilityScope` — ticket selection, promotions, FAQs, recommendations, checkout
- Flow F24 *A guest asks the assistant and ends up with a person*, step 2: Asks something outside that scope → **The assistant does not attempt it.** Bounded capability is the whole reason the cost and the safety posture are tractable
- Flow F24 branch at step 2 (requiresStaff): when No agent is available, **Says so and offers a case**, rather than queuing a guest for somebody who is not there. The worst outcome here is a guest waiting in silence for a queue with nobody in it.
- Flow F24 branch at step 2 (recoverable): when The guest is at a kiosk and there is no chat agent, Falls back to `KSK-013 Call staff` and `startKioskAssist` — **the person is in the building.** A guest standing at a machine does not want a chat queue.
- Flow F24 branch at step 1 (recoverable): when The AI ceiling has been reached, **The assistant keeps answering** and the venue manager has been warned (CF-14). A cap that stops mid-visit turns a cost control into a guest-facing outage.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (3), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400, 403, 404, 409, 422).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (37 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#KSK-015?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Talk to a person.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `SUP-004`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The module and platform inputs below are applied.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] The 2 edge case(s) from the process notes are drawn.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Decided for every guest screen:** **No dark or light mode.** The venue's chosen theme applies on every device setting; `Theme.darkMode` is deprecated and ignored, never drawn, and the guest app has no Light/Dark switch (Chinmay, 2 October, Q150; CHG-CSA-035). ***Powered by TICVAI* is a tenant toggle, on by default** (`brand.showPoweredBy`): shown on the launch screen, at the foot of Account and in the web footer; switching it off needs the licence add-on, or 403 `powered-by-locked` (Chinmay, 2 October, Q160; DI-297; CHG-CSA-036). **Each homepage section sets its card count and its scroll animation** (`maxItems`; `scrollAnimation` rise, scale, slide, blur or none, default rise): every customisation option of the approved wireframe (Chinmay, 2 October, Q152 and Q153; DI-1088; CHG-CSA-040). **Landing-page templates.** A tenant with no landing page of its own starts from a TICVAI template (`listLandingPageTemplates`, kept as `HomepageLayout.templateKey`); one with its own site links in with deep links (`landingSource` ownSite) (Chinmay, 2 October, batch 2 #41; CHG-CSA-037).

**Never configurable:** A dark or light mode: the guest surfaces have one theme, the venue's (Chinmay, 2 October; CHG-CSA-035). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P05 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the newest client-approved guest look. The kiosk is the same product, narrower.
- `wireframes/reference/Kiosk Board 1.dc.html`: the client's kiosk board, for layout (and Kiosk Board 2).

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

**Workshop tracker rows about P05 as a whole** (6: 0 open, 6 closed). Open first; a closed row says where it went on 30 September.

- **A54** Design centralized, venue-level inventory model with an inter-venue stock-transfer workflow, ensuring sales across web/mobile/kiosk/POS channels all draw from the same system-recorded stock (not physical stock) per venue *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker)*
- **A56** Confirm and implement branding rules across surfaces: TICVAI branding (with "Powered by TICVAI") on staff-facing POS/tablet devices, and white-labeled, client-branded UI on guest-facing kiosks *(Softlabs Design Team · Medium · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker)*
- **A192** Design a single-matrix channel-and-variant pricing view (adult/child × onsite/online/kiosk), benchmarked against the referenced competitor tool *(Softlabs Design Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S9 (final UI/UX) · 31 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A226** Build facial recognition in two tiers (Face Pass for memberships, Face Tag for single visits) with enrolment via app, web, POS, kiosk or turnstile, plus re-enrolment and fallback media *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 2 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A246** Support virtual queue via app (theme parks) and kiosk/wristband scan (water parks) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 7 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A290** Build redemption tickets/rewards, card lifecycle, live monitoring and self-service kiosk *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 11 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*

- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system.

Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*

- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*

- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P05 Guest Kiosk

- Allam: water-park guests rarely carry phones, so a kiosk at the ride lets a guest scan their wristband to book a queue slot and get a return time, then scan the wristband again to enter. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.14 Virtual Queue - Multi-Venue Applicability · DI-677)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Top-up rules set minimum and maximum amounts per transaction; channel/funding-source mapping restricts which payment methods each channel offers (e.g. cash top-up on-site only, not online), so each channel's top-up screen offers only its allowed methods. *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding, Top-Up & Reload Management · DI-517)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Kiosks are guest-facing: white-labelled to the client's branding like the guest website, while keeping a kiosk-specific layout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-298)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Allam: the cashier design must work consistently across all cashier device types: POS terminals, tablets, iPads and kiosks. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 3. UX Design Approach Discussion · DI-101)*
- Selling a capacity-based product (e.g. seat-assigned tickets) while offline is blocked with a clear notification, never allowed through or silently failing; non-capacity products stay sellable offline. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-074)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.

A guest buying the second and being sold the first has bought the wrong ticket.\n**Transport uses two existing kinds, not a new one** (decided 29 September, rev 3 REV3-21). A one-way trip is `timedAdmission`: `transport.createTransportRoute` creates the route's product with one variant per passenger type, and each departure is a performance. A multi-trip or unlimited pass is `openDated`: `transport.createTransportPassType` creates it, with `EntitlementTemplate.entriesAllowed` = the pass's trips (null for unlimited), the validity = `validityDays`, and `EntitlementTemplate.transportRestriction` naming the station pair the pass was bought for, so `access` refuses it on another journey. The sale path is unchanged: both are cart lines, priced by `transport.quoteTransportFare` (orders `TransportLineAttributes`).\n","enum":["admission","timedAdmission","datedAdmission","openDated","seated","membership","bundle","fnb","retail","rental","addOn","giftCard"]},
