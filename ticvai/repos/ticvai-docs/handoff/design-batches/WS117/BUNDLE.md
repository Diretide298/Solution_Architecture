## Who this is for

**platformAdmin on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 3 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS, PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### AI & Intelligence

AI in TICVAI is one governed engine behind many screens. The guest meets it as Sahli, the concierge (WEB-044, GST-031, GST-033), as the planner agent that refines a rules-built day plan by chat (GST-054), and as upsell and cross-sell offers on a separate Extras step (WEB-008, GST-048). Staff meet it as the Staff App's AI tab (EMP-019/020, knowledge EMP-040/041), the kiosk assistant (KSK-015) and the support copilot (SUP-006, SUP-018). Venue managers meet it in Venue Management (BO-091 policy and spend, BO-919/BO-925..932 resource and staffing forecasts, BO-597/598 configuration drafts, BO-772/782 marketing optimisation, BO-793 translations, BO-970/975 seat-map generation, BO-1048 seat upsell, BO-1160 fraud cases) and in Analytics (ANL-010 suggestions, ANL-019 management insights, ANL-055 anomalies, ANL-057 forecasting studio, ANL-059 insight history, ANL-060 governance, ANL-071 AI maturity). The governance, configuration-assistant, forecasting, oversight, audit and monitoring boards sit on the TICVAI Console (P09: ADM-037 providers, ADM-469..498 configuration assistant, ADM-499..518 forecasting, ADM-519..558 governance, ADM-633/637 fraud, ADM-680..697 recommendation governance). Five rules hold on every one of these screens. (1) Baseline first, then it learns per tenant: every data-driven answer (forecast, suggestion, risk score, recommendation) exists from day one, from the venue AI profile, a starting pattern for the venue type, the UAE calendar and the weather, and shifts to the venue's own data as it trades; nothing says "comes later" or refuses for lack of history - a refusal only names a missing setting. (2) Every answer shows its basis and maturity: a "Based on" line, a stage badge (Starting, Learning, Established, Trained on your data), "Limited historical data" while the starting pattern carries more than half the weight, ranges or bands rather than a bare percentage, a confidence only where the producer really has one, a plain-words explanation always. (3) A trained model replaces the baseline only when it beats it in a shadow run of at least six weeks and an admin promotes it; the platform raises "Ready to promote" and never switches by itself. (4) The LLM never reads raw data: numbers come only from query results the platform runs (the answer shows the query), only the masked prompt and retrieved context leave the platform, and AI only drafts - the owning screen applies. (5) One autonomy scale, L0 Disabled to L4 Controlled auto, with first-release ceilings, separate from user permission and from the approval tier; impactful actions route to a person, who sees current against proposed, impact, risk and what is affected, and can approve within a limit, challenge, override or roll back; every decision is traceable (data, model, approver, time) and searchable by customer, venue and capability.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `ADM-479` AI Configuration Build Command Center

**Provide a central workspace showing how the Board 1 blueprint is being converted into actual TICVAI configuration objects.**

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getActionPlan` (AI_USE), `getConfigurationBlueprint` (AI_USE), `buildConfigurationPlan` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Build command centre: how the blueprint is being turned into real configuration objects - areas, objects proposed, ready, warnings, conflicts, missing configuration, recommendations and what needs approval. The one thing to get right: it shows the plan's status on the action-plan lifecycle (draft → validated → simulated → awaiting approval → approved → executing), not a free-form progress bar.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tenant | picker: choose an id | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | **Pick a tenant first** (audit R098; decided 2 October 2026, Chinmay: console screens get the tenant picker and grant, CHG-SBO-001). This screen's operations run in that tenant's cell, and a platform … | `Tenant.id` |

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Module | text field | — | — | `getConfigurationBlueprint` ?module |
| Decision class | segmented control | — | Required · Recommended · Optional | `getConfigurationBlueprint` ?decisionClass |
| Status | radio group | — | Onboarding · Active · Suspended · Terminating · Terminated | `listTenants` ?status |
| Plan | picker: choose a plan | — | — | `listTenants` ?planId |

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ID `id` | picker: choose an id | required | — | — | shows names, sends the id | Client-generated UUIDv7 for the grant. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Permissions `permissions` | multi-select chips | required | — | SESSION FORCE LOGOUT · USER MANAGE · ROLE MANAGE · PERMISSION GRANT · PERMISSION VIEW · PERMISSION MANAGE · PLATFORM TENANT VIEW · PLATFORM TENANT MANAGE · PLATFORM TENANT TERMINATE · PLATFORM PLAN MANAGE · PLATFORM CELL VIEW · PLATFORM CELL MANAGE …; at … | — | What the operator may do in this tenant while the grant is open. Tenant permissions only; a `PLATFORM_*` value is refused `400`. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Reason `reason` | text area | required | — | min length 3; max length 500 | — | — | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Ticket ref `ticketRef` | text field | optional | — | max length 100 | — | The support case this access serves, where there is one. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Expires at `expiresAt` | date and time picker | required | — | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

**Rules for what is shown** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **plan status**: Stage track of AiActionPlan.status with counts per module; "Approval required" links to the approval workflow. *(source: contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#getActionPlan / contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#/components/schemas/AiActionPlan)*

**Data it reads**: `getActionPlan` (onLoad, A plan with its steps); `getConfigurationBlueprint` (onLoad, The blueprint so far); `listTenants` (onLoad, The tenant picker: the operator picks a tenant before …)

**Where the user goes next**

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The build list; the counts above it resolve separately. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the build untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No build yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the build are still there. The pack's own statuses are Building Configuration — the state names which is selected. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 The blueprint is not ready: a required decision is open or deferred (AIC-115). |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
tiles:
  areas: 6
  objectsProposed: 46
  ready: 41
  warnings: 3
  conflicts: 1
  approvalRequired: 12
```

#### Permissions

- `getActionPlan` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `getConfigurationBlueprint` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `buildConfigurationPlan` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

1 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.6.6 | It is expected to have one webstore/application API for each venue. | Ticketing Sales | CONTRACTED | data `Tenant` |

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 1 for P09 · Platform, 9 for all of P09, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getActionPlan` (AI_USE), `getConfigurationBlueprint` (AI_USE), `decideBlueprintRecommendation` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Venue and organisation configuration proposed from the blueprint: organisation, venues, zones, opening calendar - as draft objects to review per field, with what the assistant inferred marked. The one thing to get right: each proposed object shows the owning module's fields, and accepting here only accepts the proposal.

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The venue organization list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the venue organization untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No venue organization yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the venue organization are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 The session is no longer open for decisions (`session-not-open`). |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
venue:
  name: Coastal Aqua
  zones:
  - Wave pool
  - Kids splash
  - Lazy river
  - Cabanas
  calendar: Closed Mondays Jun-Aug
```

#### Permissions

- `getActionPlan` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `getConfigurationBlueprint` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `decideBlueprintRecommendation` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

1 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Products proposed by the assistant, in the existing ticketing model: product, variants, guest categories, validity, entitlement, add-ons. The one thing to get right: the assistant asks for any missing required field (e.g. capacity) before drafting, and unstructured input (a brochure, a photo of a price board) can seed it.

- The AI configuration assistant is conversational and iterative: on "I want to create a product" it asks follow-ups (ticket type, validity, date/time) and, if required information such as capacity is missing, asks for it rather than proceeding, before showing a configuration blueprint and dependency map. *(agreed · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.5 AI Configuration Assistant — Conversational Requirement Gathering · DI-937)*
- Phase-one AI priority is a conversational configuration assistant: the admin says e.g. "I want to configure a new product" and it asks the product type (admission, time slot, etc.) and walks through product/promotion setup. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 1.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

### `ADM-483` Pricing & Commercial Configuration

**Convert commercial requirements into proposed pricing, tax, fee, and commercial rules using TICVAI's existing Pricing architecture.**

|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Control · P09 TICVAI Web (web) |
| Module | Platform · wave 3 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | Block D · task APP-CONSOLE-ADM-483 |
| Who uses it | ticvai staff holding `AI_USE`, `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS`, `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (2 operate, 1 read); in the flows as platform admin |
| Device and orientation | This is the TICVAI console on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail, a top bar with the tenant switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): the pack gives this screen a display directory (§Show) and no metric row |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `decisionKey` (navigation), `planId` (navigation), `sessionId` (session), `tenantId` (navigation) |
| Route | `/platform/pricing-commercial-configuration-adm-483` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getActionPlan` (AI_USE), `getConfigurationBlueprint` (AI_USE), `decideBlueprintRecommendation` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **This screen's operations return no schema with described properties**, so not one of its columns can be bound. The columns are the pack's own labels and are carried as text until the response shape … Removed 2 October 2026 (CHG-WIR-012): The assistant only drafts (ADR-0020); pricing is written by the plan's executor after approval, through the owning API, so the direct write …

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Prices, taxes, fees and commercial rules proposed from the commercial answers, using the existing pricing model, with a price simulation. The one thing to get right: pricing is high risk - every proposed price is a draft that routes for approval (L3 at most for the configuration assistant), and VAT treatment is shown explicitly.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **Table columns are board values ("AED 120", "AED 20", "Adult / Saturday / B2C").** Why: Sample values, not columns. *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-483; AI & Intelligence)*

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The screen calls setChannelPricingCommercial (PRODUCT_CONFIGURE) directly. (CHG-WIR-012).

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
proposals:
- kind: bundle
  name: Family Day Pass (2+2)
  effect: AED 540 vs AED 600 separately
  why: You said families are 60% of visitors
- kind: upsell
  from: Day Pass
  to: Annual Pass
```

#### Permissions

- `getActionPlan` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `getConfigurationBlueprint` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `decideBlueprintRecommendation` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

### `ADM-485` Seating, Access & Operational Configuration

**Configure the operational rules required to fulfill and validate the products. The screen should adapt depending on venue type. For the museum example, seating is irrelevant and should not consume UI attention.**

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getActionPlan` (AI_USE), `getConfigurationBlueprint` (AI_USE), `decideBlueprintRecommendation` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Seating, access and operational rules for fulfilling and validating the products; the screen adapts to the venue type - for a museum, seating is irrelevant and takes no space. The one thing to get right: sections not relevant to the blueprint collapse to a single "Not needed for this venue" line.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tenant | picker: choose an id | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | **Pick a tenant first** (audit R098; decided 2 October 2026, Chinmay: console screens get the tenant picker and grant, CHG-SBO-001). This screen's operations run in that tenant's cell, and a platform … | `Tenant.id` |

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

### `ADM-487` Cross-Module Conflict & Dependency Validation

**Perform a comprehensive validation of the proposed configuration across all TICVAI modules before it is presented for approval. This should be one of the most important screens in Board 2.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Control · P09 TICVAI Web (web) |
| Module | Platform · wave 3 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | Block D · task APP-CONSOLE-ADM-487 |
| Who uses it | ticvai staff holding `AI_USE`, `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS`, `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (2 operate, 1 read); in the flows as platform admin |
| Device and orientation | This is the TICVAI console on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail, a top bar with the tenant switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | commandCentre (compact density): the pack gives this screen a metric directory (§Header KPIs) and no per-row directory — measures over a population the screen does not itself list. The tiles are the pack's, not a tenant licence's |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `planId` (navigation), `tenantId` (navigation) |
| Route | `/platform/cross-module-conflict-dependency-validation-adm-487` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getActionPlan` (AI_USE), `simulateActionPlan` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack names 3 actions on this screen and the screen declares 0 operations.** Unserved: Link Existing, Configure Later, Ask AI. Each needs an operation, or needs removing from the screen; this is …

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Cross-module validation before approval: every proposed object checked against every module's rules - passed, warnings, conflicts, missing dependencies, approval requirements - by simulating the plan without changing anything. The one thing to get right: each issue names the object, the rule it fails and the module that owns the rule, with a resolution (link an existing object, configure later, ask the assistant).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tenant | picker: choose an id | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | **Pick a tenant first** (audit R098; decided 2 October 2026, Chinmay: console screens get the tenant picker and grant, CHG-SBO-001). This screen's operations run in that tenant's cell, and a platform … | `Tenant.id` |

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Status | radio group | — | Onboarding · Active · Suspended · Terminating · Terminated | `listTenants` ?status |
| Plan | picker: choose a plan | — | — | `listTenants` ?planId |

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ID `id` | picker: choose an id | required | — | — | shows names, sends the id | Client-generated UUIDv7 for the grant. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |

Tenant permissions only; a `PLATFORM_*` value is refused `400`. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Reason `reason` | text area | required | — | min length 3; max length 500 | — | — | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Ticket ref `ticketRef` | text field | optional | — | max length 100 | — | The support case this access serves, where there is one. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Expires at `expiresAt` | date and time picker | required | — | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

**Rules for what is shown** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **validation results**: Per object and step - pass, warning, conflict, missing dependency, governance-blocked (a step failing a module limit is never applied). *(source: contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#simulateActionPlan / DI-955)*

**What each action does** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Validate (simulate)**: Plan moves to validated/simulated; nothing changes in any module. *(source: contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#simulateActionPlan)*
- **Link existing / Configure later / Ask AI**: Per-issue resolutions; Ask AI opens the interview with the issue as the question. *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-487)*

**Data it reads**: `getActionPlan` (onLoad, A plan with its steps); `listTenants` (onLoad, The tenant picker: the operator picks a tenant before …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `ADM-479` AI Configuration Build Command Center: *Back to AI Configuration Build Command Center*; carries `planId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The cross-module conflict dependency list; the counts above it resolve separately. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the cross-module conflict dependency untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No cross-module conflict dependency yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the cross-module conflict dependency are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 The plan is executing or finished; simulate a rollback plan instead. |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
issue:
  object: Product Day Pass on channel Reseller
  rule: A product needs a channel price before publishing
  owner: Catalogue
  resolution: Configure later
```

#### Permissions

- `getActionPlan` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `simulateActionPlan` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

1 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

The Console runs outside every cell; `getActionPlan` (AI_USE), `simulateActionPlan` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** The full preview and impact before approval: the proposed configuration in business terms (what guests will be able to buy, when, at what price) and technical terms (objects per module), what it affects (existing bookings, channels) and where each value came from. The one thing to get right: impact on existing bookings is explicit - purchased tickets never change retroactively.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **The layout is the board's navigation outline as text fields ("1. AI Configuration Build Command Center" ... "Board: 3 of 3").** Why: Board text, not fields; draw the preview. *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-488; AI & Intelligence)*

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P09 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/6-ticvai-controller/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html`: the client-approved POS, for operator density and components.
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html`: for finish and motion.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-041, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*

- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*

- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print).

- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P09 TICVAI Web

- Portal access exposes TICVAI pricing, so prospects submit contact details and a trade license as proof of a real venue, reviewed and approved by TICVAI before access is granted. *(agreed · MoM 10 Sep 2026, 4.8 Customer Portal Access, Authentication & Verification · DI-827)*
- Simulation functionality stays embedded within each relevant configuration section rather than being consolidated, since it tests that section's own configuration. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-722)*
- **Open question.** Proposed tenant hierarchy Tenant > Organization/Brand > Region > Branch > Venue > Department, under review against TICVAI's own organisational hierarchy before finalising. *(open · MoM 30 Jul 2026, 2. Proposed Multi-Tenant Hierarchy · DI-055)*

- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*

### In P09 · Platform

- **Open question.** Open: should AI monitoring live in one centralised AI command dashboard or be distributed as widgets in each functional module's own dashboard? Allam: Softlabs' call; the current proposal is illustrative and Softlabs may propose a better structure. *(open · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.4 AI Governance — Risk, Compliance & Continuous Monitoring · DI-936)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
