## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, PRICE_VIEW, REPORT_VIEW_TENANT, REPORT_VIEW_VENUE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Finance, Ledger & Tax · Reporting & Analytics

Finance and insights run underneath every sale. A sale at a till (P04), kiosk, web storefront (P01) or guest app (P02) is priced and taxed per line at the moment of sale, recorded in the venue's base currency (AED in the UAE; 2 decimals, or 3 for BHD, KWD and OMR, never rounded away), and posted to an append-only dual ledger through account mappings per money event; anything unmapped lands in suspense. Tax follows the jurisdiction's tax profile: inclusive or exclusive, compound where a tax applies on another, zero-rated or exempt with verified evidence, and computed on the discounted price by default or on the price before discount where the region requires it (Egypt). A guest may select a currency the venue charges and pay in it: the rate is locked on the order, the payment partner is asked in that currency, the ledger keeps the base amount with the rate, and a refund goes back in the currency paid (decided 2 October 2026, Chinmay); a currency shown but not charged is an approximate price. Foreign cash at a till is recorded at its base equivalent and change is given in base currency. A paid order can carry a VAT receipt (simplified tax invoice), a full tax invoice with the buyer's TRN, or a consolidated invoice for a company, each numbered without gaps and never edited; corrections are credit memos. Revenue is recognised by rule: POS-style immediate, tickets on the visit, gift cards and wallet on use, annual passes straight-line or per visit, breakage on expiry; deferred revenue is a balance that ages. Each venue's day is reconciled (POS cash, gateways, bank, wallet against the ledger, provider files matched automatically, only genuine mismatches to a person); chargebacks are defended against the bank's deadline; month end runs seven close checks and goes to a finance approver. Nothing posted is deleted: a correction is a reversal, an approver is never the preparer, and ledger approval needs a second factor. Back-office finance lives in Venue Management (P08: chart of accounts, mapping, FX, journals, recognition, reconciliation, period close, chargebacks); tax profiles, calculation validation and platform reconciliation in the TICVAI Console (P09); partner settlement in P10. Reporting is one consolidated, permission-based area (Analytics, P16): seeded standard dashboards and reports plus no-code builders over a governed business catalogue; the P08 report screens, the POS terminal day view and the kitchen performance view are scoped windows onto the same definitions and must show the same numbers. Every figure is read from a lag-tolerant reporting copy and shows its "as of" time; scope comes from the person's rights, never from a filter; AI explains and recommends but never acts, answers only within the person's role, labels forecasts, and is phase two for finance ledgers.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale)

A guest finds something to do, picks when and how many, holds capacity, pays, and receives a ticket they can show at the gate, transfer or resell. The same booking engine serves the guest website (P01, WEB-), the guest app (P02, GST-) and, through the same catalogue, cart and order operations, the kiosk (P05), the cashier at the till (P04) and the staff handheld (P06); partners book on credit through the partner portal (P10). Guest surfaces are white-label (venue logo, colours, fonts, card layouts, step indicator style, cart placement) with "Powered by TICVAI" kept; the till and handheld stay TICVAI-branded. The booking runs in a fixed order that the client set on 29 September and confirmed on 30 September: for a dated product, the date first, then the time (hidden until a date), then the tickets (hidden until a time); undated products go straight to the tickets; product-first flows (workshops) pick the product, then the date; seated events with one performance open on the seat map, sections first, zoom into a section, pinch out to compare. Choosing a date, time or session commits nothing; capacity is held only when a quantity is set (a 15-minute basket window, 8 minutes for seats and cabanas, one extension). The guest counters (adult, child, senior, infant, person of determination) belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices, so a basket line is "<ticket> · <guest type> × <n>"; group and school products start from group ticket cards and a typed headcount (minus, plus, and +10 on the app), supervisors free. Help me choose filters the catalogue on the server (never a consent step) with Show everything; consent questions such as "Are you able to swim?" are asked once after the session is picked and never again where the page already asked. Sign-in or the six-digit guest code is asked when the guest leaves Add-ons (or at payment, per venue), only the fields the venue configured; after the code, only the T&Cs tick remains (W1). Payment creates the order first and treats an unknown outcome as "checking with your bank", never a second charge; tickets issue on payment, go to Apple or Google Wallet, and a dynamic-QR event's ticket lives in the app. The guest app is deliberately not a copy of the website (30 September): its structure is Home, Explore, Plan and Tickets tabs with a persistent Buy tickets button, item pages that propose the right product (a restaurant's meal combo that includes admission), ride videos that play with no loader, a visit planner that plans each day at one park from that park's rides, dining and shops only, and in-park walking navigation; the booking flow inside it is functionally identical to the web. Vocabulary in guest copy follows the glossary's recorded exceptions (Booking, Session, QR). source: [F01, F02, F03, F07, F49, F52, F55, F57, F58, F59, MoM 29 Sep 1 (W1-W12), MoM 29 Sep 2, MoM 29 Sep 3, MoM 30 Sep 4.4-4.8, CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP 1-6, CLIENT-RESPONSE-REV3-25SEP, REV3-1, REV3-2, REV3-3, REV3-4, REV3-26, DI-1086 …

### AI & Intelligence

AI in TICVAI is one governed engine behind many screens. The guest meets it as Sahli, the concierge (WEB-044, GST-031, GST-033), as the planner agent that refines a rules-built day plan by chat (GST-054), and as upsell and cross-sell offers on a separate Extras step (WEB-008, GST-048). Staff meet it as the Staff App's AI tab (EMP-019/020, knowledge EMP-040/041), the kiosk assistant (KSK-015) and the support copilot (SUP-006, SUP-018). Venue managers meet it in Venue Management (BO-091 policy and spend, BO-919/BO-925..932 resource and staffing forecasts, BO-597/598 configuration drafts, BO-772/782 marketing optimisation, BO-793 translations, BO-970/975 seat-map generation, BO-1048 seat upsell, BO-1160 fraud cases) and in Analytics (ANL-010 suggestions, ANL-019 management insights, ANL-055 anomalies, ANL-057 forecasting studio, ANL-059 insight history, ANL-060 governance, ANL-071 AI maturity). The governance, configuration-assistant, forecasting, oversight, audit and monitoring boards sit on the TICVAI Console (P09: ADM-037 providers, ADM-469..498 configuration assistant, ADM-499..518 forecasting, ADM-519..558 governance, ADM-633/637 fraud, ADM-680..697 recommendation governance). Five rules hold on every one of these screens. (1) Baseline first, then it learns per tenant: every data-driven answer (forecast, suggestion, risk score, recommendation) exists from day one, from the venue AI profile, a starting pattern for the venue type, the UAE calendar and the weather, and shifts to the venue's own data as it trades; nothing says "comes later" or refuses for lack of history - a refusal only names a missing setting. (2) Every answer shows its basis and maturity: a "Based on" line, a stage badge (Starting, Learning, Established, Trained on your data), "Limited historical data" while the starting pattern carries more than half the weight, ranges or bands rather than a bare percentage, a confidence only where the producer really has one, a plain-words explanation always. (3) A trained model replaces the baseline only when it beats it in a shadow run of at least six weeks and an admin promotes it; the platform raises "Ready to promote" and never switches by itself. (4) The LLM never reads raw data: numbers come only from query results the platform runs (the answer shows the query), only the masked prompt and retrieved context leave the platform, and AI only drafts - the owning screen applies. (5) One autonomy scale, L0 Disabled to L4 Controlled auto, with first-release ceilings, separate from user permission and from the approval tier; impactful actions route to a person, who sees current against proposed, impact, risk and what is affected, and can approve within a limit, challenge, override or roll back; every decision is traceable (data, model, approver, time) and searchable by customer, venue and capability.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

## Thin screens in this batch

**ANL-018 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*

### Across P16 Venue Analytics

- One consolidated, permission-based reporting/dashboard area: a user opens "dashboards" once and sees all dashboards their access allows (finance sees finance; a CEO sees sales, admissions, access control), with dashboard settings there too - not duplicated dashboard screens inside each functional module. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-721)*
- Dashboards should refresh near-real-time (seconds) so management can monitor sales continuously rather than wait for periodic or end-of-day refreshes. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.6 Real-Time Reporting Architecture · DI-711)*
- Dashboards must be mobile-responsive so management (e.g. a CEO outside the venue) can log in from a smartphone via a URL rather than needing a laptop. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.1 Rationale for a Native BI/Reporting Platform · DI-696)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- Back office is role-driven from any device: a finance user signing in from a workstation, laptop or home sees only finance reports and related information. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 3. Role-Based Access and Workstation-Linked Front-End · DI-248)*
- Load/traffic dashboards respect the tenancy model: a venue manager sees traffic for their own venue only. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-061)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- AI Assistant panel: a short framing ("Based on last 30 days, here are 3 actions that can improve your revenue") then actionable recommendations, each with its potential impact (e.g. "Increase pricing for VIP seats, +12%") and a chevron, plus "View all recommendations". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - AI Panels · DI-043)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*
- Reports and historical searches must still retrieve archived transactions when required; the retention period (e.g. keep 3 of 5+ years live) is configurable per customer, archival manual or automated. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 23. Database Optimisation and Archiving · DI-018)*
