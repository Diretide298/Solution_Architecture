## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 6 permissions apply here:
  `AI_USE, GUEST_VIEW, PRODUCT_CONFIGURE, PRODUCT_VIEW, TENANT_CONFIGURE, TENANT_PUBLISH`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### White Label & CMS

A tenant (one operator, one or many venues) brands and arranges its own guest surfaces, the guest web (P01), the guest app (P02) and the kiosk (P05), from the Venue CMS (P13, a section of the Venue Management app), and TICVAI platform staff can do the same from the console (P09 ADM-016..018) only under a time-boxed grant into the tenant. Everything is configuration over a fixed structure: the guest flow, the page structure and the components are TICVAI's and stay the same for every tenant; the tenant chooses graphics, colours, fonts, which modules and tabs appear, the order of homepage sections and booking steps within allowed limits, copy in each language, and its domain. It never adds components. Work happens in ONE working draft per tenant; nothing a guest sees changes until a person with TENANT_PUBLISH publishes the draft as an immutable version (with a note), and a rollback is restore into the draft, review the diff, then publish, never one click. Three things are deliberately outside the draft and take effect at once: the live app status (maintenance, minimum app version, contact, sold out or closed), a venue's Help me choose publish, and policies (each save is a new version). Build-time parts (app icons, native splash, custom font files, wallet and payment integrations) reach guests only with a new store build, which the client publishes under its own Apple and Google accounts (CMS-104). Staff surfaces (POS, scanner, staff app, kitchen display) never take tenant branding; every guest surface carries the "Powered by TICVAI" credit, a toggle that is on by default (decided 2 October 2026, CHG-NOTE-009; DI-297 amended). Arabic is a first-class layout: enabling `ar` requires an Arabic font, the whole layout mirrors (numbers, times, codes and logos do not), and every authored text is a per-language value. The step-based Site Builder (CMS-102) walks a new tenant through seven steps from a venue-type preset so that a logo, four colours and a publish are enough for a working site in about 30 minutes; every step opens the full screen for its details. Vocabulary below; the element-by-element model follows; inputToOutput at the end gives worked examples.

| Say | Meaning | Never say | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Draft | The tenant's one working configuration. Every Save writes it; guests never see it. | Staging, Unsaved, Pending | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/info |
| Publish | Make the draft the live version guests read, with a note. Needs TENANT_PUBLISH. | Go live, Deploy, Push, Save and publish | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#publishTenantConfig |
| Save | Write to the draft. Never publishes. | Apply, Update live | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/info |
| Version | An immutable published snapshot, numbered, with who published it and the note. | Release, Revision, Backup | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/ConfigVersion |
| Restore into draft | Copy an old version back into the draft. Publishes nothing. | Roll back, Revert, Undo | R139 |
| Live now | The changes that bypass the draft and apply at once (maintenance, availability, minimum app version, contact, Help me choose publish, policies). | Instant publish | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#setMaintenanceMode |
| Needs an app update | A build-time change (app icon, native splash, uploaded font, wallet or payment integration) that reaches app users only with a new store build. | Rebuild required, Build-time, Pending release | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/ChangeScope |
| Theme | The tenant's colours, corner radius, surfaces and buttons. | Skin, Template, Style sheet | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/Theme |
| Booking flow | The ordered steps a guest goes through to book one kind of product at one venue. | Checkout flow, Journey, Funnel, Wizard | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/BookingFlow |
| Step | One stage of a booking flow (Date, Time, Tickets, Extras, Payment...). Marked Required, Optional or Conditional. | Page, Stage, Screen | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/BookingFlowStepKey |
| Help me choose | The venue's short set of questions that filters the products shown. Never a consent step. | Quiz, Experience builder, Wizard, Recommender | DI-1005 |
| Module | A licensed product area a tenant switches on for guests (Dining, Shop, Map...). Off means hidden, not greyed. | Plugin, App, Feature | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#setModuleEnablement |
| Feature | A finer switch inside the guest app (guest checkout, AI concierge, Apple Wallet...). | Module, Add-on | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#setFeatureToggles |

| Powered by TICVAI | The platform credit on every guest surface; a toggle, on by default, off only where the venue's licence allows. | Built by TICVAI, Made by TICVAI | DI-297 / decided 2 October 2026 by Chinmay (CHG-NOTE-009) |
| Site Builder | The seven-step guided set-up (CMS-102). | Wizard, Onboarding, Setup assistant | DI-997 |
| Venue override | A booking setting one venue sets differently from the tenant; everything else is inherited. | Exception, Custom setting | DI-1063 |
| Sold out today / Closed | The two availability signals guests see; sold out means come another day, closed means the venue is not open. | Unavailable, Error | R073 |
| Maintenance | The tenant-branded page shown while the guest web and app are switched off, with when they are expected back. | Down, Outage, Offline | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#setMaintenanceMode |
| Domain | The web address the tenant's guests use; Verify proves the tenant controls it before a certificate is issued. | URL, Site address, DNS | contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#claimCustomDomain |


## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CMS-102` | Site Builder | A | 20 | 15 | 6 | 2 | 7 | 6 | configures | notStarted (generated) |
| `CMS-103` | Booking Flows | A | 78 | 29 | 6 | 18 | 27 | 6 | configures | notStarted (generated) |
| `CMS-104` | App Build & Store Publishing | A | 22 | 35 | 6 | 17 | 6 | 6 | configures | notStarted (generated) |

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*

- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P13 Venue CMS

- The config side panel is a reference tool only, not the CMS. The CMS will be step-based and include header/footer, logos and banners. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W12 Config side panel · DI-1014)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- Qossai: build AI-assisted site design/generation into the website builder, keeping site design (header, footer, color, font, layout) separate from content (tickets), with tickets flowing into the site's structure once published. To be explored. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 7. AI-Assisted Website Generation · DI-115)*
- Qossai: give clients as much design flexibility as possible within the configurable structure. *(client request · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-114)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*

### In P13 · White Label

- Font, header/footer (not yet in the current wireframe build), card size and layout are configurable in the mobile app, consistent with the web app's white-labelling approach. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1097)*
- Qossai (rated the CMS prototype ~70%): a client should be able to build a working site "within 30 minutes", easily adding header, footer, fonts and its own images/graphics self-service; Allam: every CMS option must visibly change something and the interface must be intuitive to navigate. *(client request · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.8 Guest Web App CMS Prototype — Feedback on Maturity & Scope Expectations · DI-988)*
- The reviewed prototype is the actual guest-facing B2C site customers browse and book from, not a CMS tool. A separate, more limited white-label interface lets a client adjust colours, fonts and layout from a menu of options; not yet built in the prototype. *(agreed · MoM 15 Sep 2026, 4.1 Guest Web/Mobile App Prototype Review - White-Labeling Configuration & Flows · DI-887)*
- Base structure (header, footer, layout) is fixed across tenants; logo, colour, font and module visibility (e.g. hide Dining or Retail) are configurable per tenant, and independently for web and mobile (e.g. a different mobile header). *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 4. White-Labeling and Customization Boundaries · DI-285)*
- Guest website and app share one CMS/publishing and the same branding, look and feel, but differ in function: the app is the full tenant experience (venue info, services, profile, purchase); a client's own website usually just links ("Buy Tickets") to a TICVAI-hosted checkout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 3. Guest Website vs. Guest Mobile App · DI-284)*
- Modules enabled/disabled per tenant by licence: Ticketing & Booking, Membership, Events, Attractions, Virtual Queue, F&B, Retail, Parking; add-ons (Lost & Found, AI Concierge Chat, multi-language, integrations) toggle the same way and appear automatically as new integrations are built. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-193)*
- Allam: banner, header, footer and background color are CMS-configurable per client, but site structure and navigation flow are fixed and adapt automatically to product configuration (dated, non-dated, seated, membership products surface the right fields). *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 9. Website Structure, Localization & Authentication · DI-119)*
- A "powered by [platform]" footer credit is fixed and not client-editable. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-111)*
- White-label sites share one platform/template but each is configured independently: header, footer, logo, colors, fonts and hero banner are client-editable from the backend. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 6. B2C/B2B Website Walkthrough (Multi-Site, White-Label) · DI-108)*

### Screen by screen

**`CMS-102` Site Builder**

- The "Category display" configuration control is retired and has no effect: remove it. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W7 Config: Category display · DI-1009)*
- CMS option to list a product (e.g. training courses) with full details but no Book button; instead show "Contact sales to book" with contact details. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W3 View-only products · DI-1004)*
- Each client owns its Apple and Google developer accounts; the app is built in the CMS from a published configuration, with an in-platform guide (D-U-N-S number, opening accounts, store listing, store review). *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, M24-08 · DI-998)*
- The CMS is a step-based site builder started from the workspace; a preset keeps the minimum path short (modules, booking flows, home sections and mobile tabs proposed), so an operator supplies only a logo, four colours and Publish; aim about 30 minutes to a working site. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, M24-05 · DI-997)*
- Confirmed final: cart sliding in from the right or bottom, card size options, and cart-sidebar placement left or right; Qossai specifically liked the compact card size. No further changes requested. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.10 Guest Web App — Card Layout & Cart Configuration Confirmed · DI-991)*
- The hero banner and marketing layer (images, video, search, browse-by-venue, venue info) is optional and toggled in the white-label builder: on for clients without their own marketing site (Qossai: roughly 30%), off for a lean direct-to-ticket flow. *(agreed · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.11 Guest Website UX Review — Page Structure & Hero Banner Flexibility · DI-945)*
- Decision (raised by Qossai): the CMS/website builder supports two modes per client using the same builder — a full landing page plus integrated ticket-sale flow (clients without a website), or B2C-only (header, product cards, footer, checkout) embedded in/linked from an existing site. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.9 Website Builder Flexibility — Standalone vs. B2C-Only Configuration · DI-431)*

**`CMS-103` Booking Flows**

- Step-indicator style is configurable, the same as on the web: bars, dots, counters or step names. *(agreed · MoM 30 Sep 2026, 4.6 Mobile App — Booking Flow & Checkout · DI-1093)*
- Existing booking settings stay: step indicator, extras step, seat picker, map view, quantities on add-ons (−/+ stepper, price multiplies), embed mode, hero banner, search in banner, single-event page. Defaults: search in banner off, seat picker = bowl. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-6 · Step indicator; Extras step; Seat picker; Map view; Quantities on add-ons; Embed mode; Hero banner; Search in banner; Single-event page · DI-1070)*
- A UI preset (L1–L6, or Custom) picks a bundle of booking-UI settings per venue type. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-1 · Preset (UI preset L1-L6, Custom) · DI-1065)*
- Booking-flow settings are set per tenant with a per-venue override; the CMS booking-flow settings screen must show tenant defaults and venue overrides. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, CFG-11 · Where the settings live · DI-1063)*
- On a guest's first booking visit, a four-step coach-mark tour highlights date, time, tickets and basket, with Back, Next / Done and End tour; a "Quick tour" button on the booking page replays it. Setting "Quick tour", default off; first-visit flag kept on the device only. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-20 · 20. Enable or disable a Quick Tour that describes the customer journey · DI-1060)*
- Multi-location attractions: the guest picks a location first (e.g. Al Barsha, Mirdif, Yas Island, Sharjah); a "Booking at" bar on later booking steps has Change location. On a switch, times and prices refresh and the selection is cleared unless the products share a family. Setting "Location switcher". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-18 · 18. One tenant with an attraction in several locations; change location · DI-1058)*
- Category tiles (e.g. Permanent exhibition, Temporary exhibitions, Guided tours, Courses & workshops), then that category's tickets with Adult / Child / Student counters. Setting "Ticket categories": Category → subcategory (default) or Flat list (all tickets under category headings). *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-16 · 16. Choose category, then subcategory, configurable in the CMS · DI-1056)*
- Cart & summary options: sidebar fixed right, sidebar left, slide-in right, slide-up bottom, floating cart icon (round basket button with item count opening the slide-in basket), single column. In Arabic the basket stays on the right by default (client confirmed); "Cart side in Arabic" can mirror to left. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-10 · 10. Cart display: fixed on right, slide bar, icon, bottom; right for Arabic · DI-1051)*
- A time bar above the seat map shows the chosen performance, lets the guest switch show and has Change date; switching releases held seats. Setting "Time bar above seat map", default on. On the selection step, time sits directly under the date, above language & format and tickets. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-6 · 6. Time selection on top, configurable · DI-1046)*
- The 'view from your seat' box can sit Bottom (default), Right, Left or Top of the seat map (web only); on narrow screens and mobile it is always below the map. Setting "Seat view box". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-5 · 5. CMS option to show the seat view right, left, top or bottom · DI-1045)*
- Seated events with one on-sale performance go straight to the seat map (Flow 1). Otherwise date and time come first (Flow 2), either as an inline step (timed-ticket style, default) or as a pop-up dialog over the seat map. Setting "Date & time on seat events". *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-4 · 4. Flow 1 (fixed date and time) and Flow 2 (select date, then time, then seat map) · DI-1044)*
- Sign-in (or the guest code when guest checkout is on) is asked when the guest leaves the Add-ons step; the basket is kept. Setting "Ask to sign in": After add-ons (default) or At payment. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-3 · 3. The sign-in screen should appear after Add-ons · DI-1043)*
- Dated flows reveal in order: date, then time (hidden until a date is picked), then tickets (hidden until a time is picked), with a hint in place telling the guest what to pick next; Continue off until both chosen. Setting "Performance reveal": Date → time → ticket (default) or All at once. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-2 · 2. Step 1 date, step 2 time (only after the date), step 3 ticket · DI-1042)*
- More than eight times show as compact time tiles, paged with Earlier / Later (Times per page 8/12/24/all, default 24), with day-part chips (All, Morning, Afternoon, Evening) showing counts (filter on by default). Day-part boundaries are venue settings, default before 12:00 / 12:00–17:00 / from 17:00. *(agreed · rev 3 design review 29 Sep 2026, REV3-1 · 1. Many performances should resize and page; filter by morning, afternoon, evening · DI-1041)*
- Card layout is a choice, not free text: Stacked rows (default) · Split rows · Cards across · Poster cards. Card size: Compact (default) · Standard · Large · Extra large.

- The date list in the event banner (for multi-date events) is a setting, "Dates in event banner", off by default. The date picker always sits at the top of the booking step. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Settings 19. Why is there a date selection in the header? · DI-1033)*
- Each Adult / Child / Senior / Infant row has an (i) button showing who the ticket is for and what it includes (up to 300 characters). Setting "Extra info on cards", default on. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 6. Extra information for each ticket in the ticket section · DI-1028)*
- Ticket cards, Read more and the listing side panel show tags (e.g. "2 Hours", "Min 1.10 m", "Free adult entry", "Valid 90 days", "Emirates ID"), each with a kind icon (clock, height, free, calendar, id), max 6. Venue-set tags win, else derived from duration, validity, height rule. Setting "Tags on tickets", default on. *(agreed · design review 29 Sep 2026, Tickets 3. 'Read more' should carry tags customisable per ticket type · DI-1025)*
- Cleaning buffer is configurable. Option A: fixed buffer (e.g. 15 min) after every booking. Option B: N cleanings per day; the system places the buffers into the day's schedule and adjusts availability. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W10 Meeting-room cleaning buffer · DI-1012)*
- The "Category display" configuration control is retired and has no effect: remove it. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W7 Config: Category display · DI-1009)*
- Map-based cabana booking stays optional per configuration, since not every operator uses the same flow; it uses the same map back end as theme-park F&B/locations (reusable later for in-park navigation). *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W6 Cabanas · DI-1008)*
- CMS option to list a product (e.g. training courses) with full details but no Book button; instead show "Contact sales to book" with contact details. *(agreed · MoM 29 Sep 2026, 1. Website (B2C) — review of Rev 3, W3 View-only products · DI-1004)*
- The prototype validated five booking-flow types (dated, multi-park, combo, annual pass, membership) and their skeleton screens; these flows are the basis for the real white-label builder. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.8 Guest Web App CMS Prototype — Feedback on Maturity & Scope Expectations · DI-989)*
- Each ticket type gets its own flow: open-dated (no calendar step, straight to guest category/quantity, valid e.g. 30-60 days), dated (date, then product), dated-with-time (date, time, product) and seated (date, time, seat selection). *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.13 Guest Website UX Review — Ticket Type Flows & Seat Map Selection · DI-948)*
- Decision (raised by Qossai): the CMS/website builder supports two modes per client using the same builder — a full landing page plus integrated ticket-sale flow (clients without a website), or B2C-only (header, product cards, footer, checkout) embedded in/linked from an existing site. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.9 Website Builder Flexibility — Standalone vs. B2C-Only Configuration · DI-431)*
- Decision: the add-ons step is optional/removable in configuration for products with no add-ons, collapsing the flow to Ticket Selection → Cart → Checkout. *(agreed · MoM 21 Aug 2026, 4.8 B2C Checkout Journey Review; 5. Key Decisions · DI-428)*
- Allam: the venue's main website is fully venue-managed; after "Book Now" the white-label B2C flow keeps the venue's header/footer branding while product selection, cart and checkout are TICVAI-managed. Header/footer links to non-checkout pages redirect to the main venue site. *(client request · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.10 CMS & White-Label Website / Mobile App Configuration · DI-397)*

**`CMS-104` App Build & Store Publishing**

- Each client owns its Apple and Google developer accounts; the app is built in the CMS from a published configuration, with an in-platform guide (D-U-N-S number, opening accounts, store listing, store review). *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, M24-08 · DI-998)*
- Self-publishing must be guided in-platform (a guided page/instruction flow rather than only a static PDF manual); Qossai suggested an AI chat-based guide that walks the client step by step through DUNS registration and store submission. *(client request · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.13 Mobile App Deployment — Apple Developer Account Risk & Client Guidance Approach · DI-994)*
- Each client builds its app package from the CMS once configured and submits it to the App Store and Google Play under its own developer accounts (Apple DUNS); TICVAI never publishes client apps under its own account. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.12 / 4.13 Mobile App Deployment Strategy · DI-993)*
- **Open question.** Open: publishing model — each client's own App/Play Store listing vs one universal TICVAI app where the user selects the venue; and a client module with customisation screens plus a CI/CD-linked publish action vs a canvas the client exports and publishes. Softlabs to present pros/cons. *(open · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-251)*
- Qossai: the TICVAI name must always remain visible to end users of a client-branded guest app (e.g. a "Made by TICVAI" credit) and cannot be removed by the client. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 5. Guest Application Publishing and White-Labelling · DI-250)*
- The builder flow ends in a Review & Publish step before configuration goes live. *(client request · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.1 B2C Guest Mobile App — Configuration & Builder Module · DI-194)*
