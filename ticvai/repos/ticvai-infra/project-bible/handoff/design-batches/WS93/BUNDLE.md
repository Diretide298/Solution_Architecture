## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 3 permissions apply here:
  `ASSET_VIEW, RENTAL_OPERATE, RENTAL_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Food, Beverage & Retail

Food & beverage, retail, rentals, inventory and procurement across the till (P04), the kitchen display (P15), the staff app (P06), Venue Management (P08), the guest web and app (P01/P02), the kiosk (P05) and the CMS (P13). COUNTER SERVICE (F108): the cashier takes the order on the Food & Drink board from the outlet's menu in force (sections in the outlet's order, option groups attached to the item), sends it to the kitchen, and only then charges — send to kitchen, then charge, for every POS F&B order (R261, upheld against the v2 frame by POSV2-4). The kitchen ticket is on the rail while the card is in the guest's hand; an unpaid sent order is cancelled while ordered or accepted and voided with a reason after (R125(3), R091(5)); the guest gets an order number, and the customer-facing status board (numbers only) is the kitchen display's KIT-007, mirrored on the till's queue (POSV2-7). TABLE SERVICE (F29, F80, F94): a party is seated with its covers, orders across the visit, courses are fired by the pass (DI-333, DI-407), the bill is printed and settled at the end and split by amount, covers, category, item or seat (DI-106); the client's table statuses are Available → Ordered → Table closed → Reserved with no cleaning status (DI-336); moving and merging tables stay on the staff app until after r2 (POSV2-8). GUEST ORDERING (F11, F48): a guest inside the venue orders in the app or web for pickup or delivery to a seat or a scanned location (DI-288, DI-291); F&B and retail are optional licensed modules completed inside TICVAI (DI-505), kept simple (DI-1091); no food without an admission ticket (DI-292); table reservations and the waitlist do not go through the cart and a dining deposit is a venue option, off by default (DI-1048, DI-1049, R077). KITCHEN (P15, F83, F88): TICVAI's own display on commodity screens (19 September, replacing the 31 July "integration point only", DI-077); one kitchen ticket per preparation station from the outlet's routing rules with a fallback display (DI-323); a fired timer counts up and resets per course, not shown for quick service (DI-334); displays are assigned to stations and filter by course, with no station-load tile in r1 (R277). 86 takes an item off sale on every till and guest menu immediately (R110(c)); guests always see "Sold out", never a missing dish. RETAIL (F17, F34, F51): scan and sell through the same cart, charge and payment as tickets and food (DI-795), one cart, one receipt and one QR per guest (DI-293); system stock per venue gates the sale (DI-294); returns by receipt or order number only in r1 (R139(c)), refund to the original tender with a reason code and note (DI-796, DI-797); Shop & Drop is paid online and collected on the way out (R236), a merchandise reservation lasts to the end of the visit day (R169, R215). TILL MONEY (F32, F73, F74, F87): the float is counted by denomination with note images and typed quantities (DI-775, DI-776, R229) while the hardware checks itself (DI-778); the close is a …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

## Thin screens in this batch

**BO-545, BO-546, BO-547, BO-548, BO-549, BO-550, BO-551, BO-552, BO-553 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `BO-544` Rental Checkout Command Center

**Provide rental operators with a real-time operational queue of customers requiring equipment checkout.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P08 Venue Management (web) |
| Module | Rentals · wave 3 · needs the `resources` module |
| Block | after Block A (B to D: set per app-module by the sprint plan) |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `RENTAL_VIEW` (1 read); in the flows as venue manager |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | commandCentre (compact density): the pack gives this screen a metric directory (§KPI Cards) and no per-row directory — measures over a population the screen does not itself list. The tiles are the pack's, not a tenant licence's |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/rentals/rental-checkout-command-center-bo-544` |

**From the Food, Beverage & Retail process.** The desk view of the check-out queue, for the station supervisor or a counter that works from a PC. Same queue, rows and counters as EMP-071 (read that note); the desk adds the venue-wide view across stations and is where overrides for blocked bookings are approved.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **Twin of EMP-071 - see the consolidated correction there listing all 30 pairs (EMP-071..EMP-100 / BO-544..BO-573) and the board 6, 7 and 8 consolidations on EMP-071, EMP-081 and EMP-091.** Why: Same operations, layout and states copied by tool; one design per step for both platforms. *(source: screens/P06-staff-app.yaml#EMP-071 / DI-671; Food, Beverage & Retail)*
- **A third set of screens covers the same operations from the Resource Management pack - BO-906 Resource Checkout Workspace (checkOutRental), BO-907 Guest & Resource Assignment (assignRentalEquipment), BO-908 Rental Duration, Extension & Return Management (extendRental, returnRental), BO-911 …** Why: Same acts reachable from three places with three designs; fold them into the consolidated check-out and return flows. *(source: contracts/satellite/rental.yaml#checkOutRental / contracts/satellite/rental.yaml#returnRental / DI-671 / DI-987; Food, Beverage & Retail)*
- **Flows F202, F203 and F204 walk the board screen by screen ("Works in <screen>", "Returns to the board's landing screen", no operations on any step) with actor venueManager, and never touch the staff app.** Why: They describe the workshop board, not the rental journey (arrive, scan, ready, assign, inspect, brief, hold deposit, check out; extend/swap/incident; scan back, inspect, settle, release); the attendant on P06 who does the work is absent. *(source: F202 step 1 / F203 step 1 / F204 step 1 / screens/P06-staff-app.yaml#EMP-071; Food, Beverage & Retail)*

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Search rental checkout | search field | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Filter by | multi select | — | — | — | — | The pack filters this screen by location, product, start time, booking type, group/individual, readiness and 1 more — which are present is a decision the pack already made. | — |

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Status | text field | — | — | `listRentalBookings` ?status |
| Location | picker: choose a location | — | — | `listRentalBookings` ?locationId |
| From | date and time picker | — | — | `listRentalBookings` ?from |
| To | date and time picker | — | — | `listRentalBookings` ?to |

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Filters**: As EMP-071, plus Venue (for a user scoped to several venues) and Location across all stations; default to the user's own station when they have one. *(source: contracts/satellite/rental.yaml#listRentalBookings / DI-061)*
- **Scan voucher**: A USB/keyboard-wedge scanner types into the search field; Enter opens the booking. *(source: DI-758 / designer default)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Arriving Next 30 Min** (metric tile)

**Awaiting Checkout** (metric tile)

**Ready for Checkout** (metric tile)

**Checkout in Progress** (metric tile)

**Checked Out Today** (metric tile)

**Missing Requirements** (metric tile)

**Equipment Issues** (metric tile)

**Late Arrivals** (metric tile)

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Food, Beverage & Retail process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Queue**: Compact table (DI-039 table card), same columns and readiness strip as EMP-071, with a Station column. *(source: DI-039 / DI-758)*

**Data it reads**: `listRentalBookings` (onLoad, Awaiting arrival)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-100` Venue Home: *Back to Venue Home*
- → `BO-545` Voucher Scan & Reservation Retrieval: *Voucher Scan & Reservation Retrieval*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-546` Checkout Readiness Validation: *Checkout Readiness Validation*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-547` Equipment Assignment Workspace: *Equipment Assignment Workspace*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-548` Equipment Scan & Validation: *Equipment Scan & Validation*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-549` Pre-Rental Condition Inspection: *Pre-Rental Condition Inspection*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-550` Safety & Handover Checklist: *Safety & Handover Checklist*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-551` Deposit & Financial Handover Validation: *Deposit & Financial Handover Validation*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-552` Group & Multi-Item Checkout: *Group & Multi-Item Checkout*; carries `bookingId`
- → `BO-553` Checkout Confirmation & Rental Activation: *Checkout Confirmation & Rental Activation*; carries `bookingId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The rental checkout list; the counts above it resolve separately. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the rental checkout untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No rental checkout yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the rental checkout are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `EMP-071`: Full refinement, counters and corrections there; one design, two densities.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
sameAs: EMP-071
extraColumn:
  station:
  - Kayak station
  - Beach Hut
  - Bike hub
```

#### Permissions

- `listRentalBookings` → `RENTAL_VIEW` (read) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Checkout screen shows bookings by status (in progress, checked out) and lets staff scan a QR code to pull up a reservation. *(client request · MoM 9 Sep 2026, 4.7 Rental Checkout & Fulfillment · DI-758)*

Also apply: 24 for all of P08, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (2), with its required mark, default, format and its error state.
- [ ] Every output is drawn (0 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#BO-544?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoResults, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] The screen has no action of its own; nothing is drawn as a button that does nothing.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `BO-100`, `BO-545`, `BO-546`, `BO-547`, `BO-548`, `BO-549`, `BO-550`, `BO-551`, `BO-552`, `BO-553`.
- [ ] Every gated control is gated: `RENTAL_VIEW`.
- [ ] The 1 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] The 3 pending correction(s) are respected: the corrected version is drawn, never the one the package still shows.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `BO-545` Voucher Scan & Reservation Retrieval

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the Food, Beverage & Retail process.** Desk form of the voucher scan (EMP-072); a USB scanner or typed reference opens the booking card. The lookup gap recorded on EMP-072 applies here too.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

### `BO-550` Safety & Handover Checklist

**Ensure mandatory operational and safety steps are completed before starting the rental. Example — Kayak ✓ Life jacket provided ✓ Paddle provided ✓ Safety briefing completed ✓ Emergency procedure explained ✓ Restricted areas explained ✓ Customer confirms swimming ability Example — Bicycle ✓ Helmet provided ✓ Brake check completed ✓ Seat adjusted ✓ Safety briefing completed The checklist should be configurable by rental product/category from Board 1.**

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  (primary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-544` Rental Checkout Command Center: *Back to Rental Checkout Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The safety handover checklist list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the safety handover checklist untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No safety handover checklist yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the safety handover checklist are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 A required precondition is not met, and the response names which — the counter needs to know whether to fetch a signature or a supervisor. |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `EMP-077`: Shared design and corrections (items not stored, no configurable list, premature submit).

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
sameAs: EMP-077
```

#### Permissions

- `checkOutRental` → `RENTAL_OPERATE` (operate) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Before handover: readiness validation (reservation, payment, inventory), a pre-rental condition checklist (e.g. bicycle brakes and tyres working) and a safety handover checklist (e.g. helmet with a bicycle). *(client request · MoM 9 Sep 2026, 4.7 Rental Checkout & Fulfillment · DI-759)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P08 Venue Management

- Qossai: configuration screens should consolidate related functionality, potentially merging 3-4 previously separate screens into one, rather than the repetitive one-screen-per-concept pattern of the AI-built reference system. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.5 Screen Consolidation Philosophy · DI-987)*
- **Open question.** Open: should AI monitoring live in one centralised AI command dashboard or be distributed as widgets in each functional module's own dashboard? Allam: Softlabs' call; the current proposal is illustrative and Softlabs may propose a better structure. *(open · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.4 AI Governance — Risk, Compliance & Continuous Monitoring · DI-936)*
- Simulation functionality stays embedded within each relevant configuration section rather than being consolidated, since it tests that section's own configuration. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-722)*
- Client boards (POS Frontline, F&B, Retail, Inventory & Procurement) share one architecture: six boards of ten screens per domain, a command centre first and an AI/analytics board last, under the hierarchy Company > Venue > Department > Workstation > Operator/Shift > Transaction > Exception > Reconciliation > Analytics. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Opening / What the boards give us · DI-400)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- **Open question.** Allam: a user's visibility must be restrictable to specific outlets (an F&B manager of one outlet should not see other outlets' items); also relevant for ticketing/event-specific access. Implementation approach still open. *(open · MoM 18 Aug 2026, 4.6 Role-Based & Outlet-Level Access Control — Open Item · DI-331)*
- Access loads automatically at login on POS and web/admin. A user with one role logs straight in; a user with several roles (e.g. admin, cashier, supervisor, manager) is prompted to choose which role to use. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 4. Multiple Roles per User and Role Switching · DI-249)*
- Back office is role-driven from any device: a finance user signing in from a workstation, laptop or home sees only finance reports and related information. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 3. Role-Based Access and Workstation-Linked Front-End · DI-248)*
- Built-in help menu with step-by-step tutorials with screenshots for common tasks (e.g. how to sell a ticket at the POS). *(client request · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 8. Legacy POS Layout Designer & System Logging · DI-160)*
- Custom data-capture fields ("data mask") at account, event, extended-ticket and product level: field types text, dropdown, radio, true/false; multi-language labels; validation (min/max length, required/optional); reusable value lists (e.g. country list). Standard fields come out of the box. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 6. Data Mask: Flexible Custom Data Capture · DI-155)*
- Load/traffic dashboards respect the tenancy model: a venue manager sees traffic for their own venue only. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-061)*
- Allam: queue management is built into the system (not third-party) so traffic entering the site can be throttled from the back office itself. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-060)*
- **Open question.** Proposed tenant hierarchy Tenant > Organization/Brand > Region > Branch > Venue > Department, under review against TICVAI's own organisational hierarchy before finalising. *(open · MoM 30 Jul 2026, 2. Proposed Multi-Tenant Hierarchy · DI-055)*
- Documentation deliverable includes user guides and help content; the preview shows a TICVAI Help Center with categories (Getting Started, Events, Tickets, Orders, Payments, Memberships, Access Control, Reports, Integrations), a "Welcome to TICVAI" getting-started article and Quick Links (Create an Event, Set Pricing, Manage Access, View Reports). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - What We Deliver / Key Deliverables Preview · DI-052)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- AI Assistant panel: a short framing ("Based on last 30 days, here are 3 actions that can improve your revenue") then actionable recommendations, each with its potential impact (e.g. "Increase pricing for VIP seats, +12%") and a chevron, plus "View all recommendations". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - AI Panels · DI-043)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Back-office shell: collapsible left sidebar with Overview, Events, Tickets, Orders, Customers, Memberships, Access Control, POS, Reports, Analytics, AI Assistant, Settings, and the signed-in user (name, role) at the bottom; top bar with global search (Cmd+K), current time and date, Notifications with unread dot, and user menu. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 04 Dashboard Vision (p4) - navigation shell · DI-030)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*
- Reports and historical searches must still retrieve archived transactions when required; the retention period (e.g. keep 3 of 5+ years live) is configurable per customer, archival manual or automated. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 23. Database Optimisation and Archiving · DI-018)*
- Back-office controls for the waiting room: configurable maximum active users and admission intervals, set per customer and venue. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 19. Auto-scaling and Virtual Waiting Room · DI-017)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

```json

```

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
