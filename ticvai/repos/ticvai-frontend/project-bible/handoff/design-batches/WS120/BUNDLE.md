## Who this is for

**platformAdmin on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 5 permissions apply here:
  `AI_CONFIGURE, AI_USE, PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS, PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW, WORKFORCE_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### AI & Intelligence

AI in TICVAI is one governed engine behind many screens. The guest meets it as Sahli, the concierge (WEB-044, GST-031, GST-033), as the planner agent that refines a rules-built day plan by chat (GST-054), and as upsell and cross-sell offers on a separate Extras step (WEB-008, GST-048). Staff meet it as the Staff App's AI tab (EMP-019/020, knowledge EMP-040/041), the kiosk assistant (KSK-015) and the support copilot (SUP-006, SUP-018). Venue managers meet it in Venue Management (BO-091 policy and spend, BO-919/BO-925..932 resource and staffing forecasts, BO-597/598 configuration drafts, BO-772/782 marketing optimisation, BO-793 translations, BO-970/975 seat-map generation, BO-1048 seat upsell, BO-1160 fraud cases) and in Analytics (ANL-010 suggestions, ANL-019 management insights, ANL-055 anomalies, ANL-057 forecasting studio, ANL-059 insight history, ANL-060 governance, ANL-071 AI maturity). The governance, configuration-assistant, forecasting, oversight, audit and monitoring boards sit on the TICVAI Console (P09: ADM-037 providers, ADM-469..498 configuration assistant, ADM-499..518 forecasting, ADM-519..558 governance, ADM-633/637 fraud, ADM-680..697 recommendation governance). Five rules hold on every one of these screens. (1) Baseline first, then it learns per tenant: every data-driven answer (forecast, suggestion, risk score, recommendation) exists from day one, from the venue AI profile, a starting pattern for the venue type, the UAE calendar and the weather, and shifts to the venue's own data as it trades; nothing says "comes later" or refuses for lack of history - a refusal only names a missing setting. (2) Every answer shows its basis and maturity: a "Based on" line, a stage badge (Starting, Learning, Established, Trained on your data), "Limited historical data" while the starting pattern carries more than half the weight, ranges or bands rather than a bare percentage, a confidence only where the producer really has one, a plain-words explanation always. (3) A trained model replaces the baseline only when it beats it in a shadow run of at least six weeks and an admin promotes it; the platform raises "Ready to promote" and never switches by itself. (4) The LLM never reads raw data: numbers come only from query results the platform runs (the answer shows the query), only the masked prompt and retrieved context leave the platform, and AI only drafts - the owning screen applies. (5) One autonomy scale, L0 Disabled to L4 Controlled auto, with first-release ceilings, separate from user permission and from the approval tier; impactful actions route to a person, who sees current against proposed, impact, risk and what is affected, and can approve within a limit, challenge, override or roll back; every decision is traceable (data, model, approver, time) and searchable by customer, venue and capability. In Block A (5 October to 20 November 2026) the guest concierge with retrieval, Help me choose, translations, the planner agent, the gateway and …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `ADM-509` Operational Forecasting Command Center

**Provide operations management with one central view of future operational pressure and predicted resource requirements.**

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getForecast` (AI_USE), `listOperationalRequirements` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Operational forecasting command centre: the operational pressure ahead - peak in-venue population, occupancy, high-pressure periods, attractions and queues at risk, required staff and the gap against the rota, required POS capacity, F&B and inventory risk. Everything is derived from the published forecast with the venue's productivity standards. The one thing to get right: each requirement is a range from a named forecast version, and the workforce gap is computed against the real rota, not invented.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **Tiles "F&B Demand Index" and "Operational Readiness Score" have no operation or definition.** Why: Define them or drop them; a score nobody can explain fails the explanation rule. *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-509 / contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#/components/schemas/Suggestion (explanation); AI & Intelligence)*
- **Filter "Tenant" on a tenant-scoped screen.** Why: Tenant is the grant's scope (see ADM-520). *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-037 (notes, R098); AI & Intelligence)*

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The operational forecasting list; the counts above it resolve separately. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the operational forecasting untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No operational forecasting yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the operational forecasting are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
tiles:
  peakInVenue: 4,100 at 13:00 (3,200-4,900)
  workforceGap: 6 short (Sat 12:00-16:00)
  requiredPos: 11 tills (busy case 13)
  attractionsAtRisk: Wave Rider, Twister Tubes
```

#### Permissions

- `getForecast` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listOperationalRequirements` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

47 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getForecast` (AI_USE), `listOperationalRequirements` (AI_USE), `configureAnomalyDetector` (AI_CONFIGURE), `listAiInsights` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Capacity and occupancy forecast: forecast attendance turned into in-venue population by hour and zone against capacity, so pressure periods are seen in advance. The one thing to get right: occupancy is drawn against the configured capacity line with the busy case shaded, and a predicted breach raises an insight.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **Unbound table and unlabelled buttons.** Why: Bind to getForecast (subject occupancy, dimension zone). *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-510; AI & Intelligence)*

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

**Data table** (data table): **Cursor pagination, never offset** — offset drifts under concurrent writes, which on a venue's busiest hour is a list that skips rows.

**Actions and what each produces**

**Rules for what is shown** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **occupancy by hour and zone**: Heat strip per zone by hour; above 85% of capacity amber, above capacity red (designer default thresholds, configurable as a detector). *(source: contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#getForecast / contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#configureAnomalyDetector)*

**Data it reads**: `getForecast` (onLoad, Forecast values); `listOperationalRequirements` (onLoad, Requirements derived from the forecast); `listAiInsights` (onLoad, Forecast threshold alerts (kind forecastThreshold)); `listTenants` (onLoad, The tenant picker: the operator picks a tenant before …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `ADM-509` Operational Forecasting Command Center: *Back to Operational Forecasting Command Center*; carries `tenantId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The capacity occupancy forecast list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the capacity occupancy forecast untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No capacity occupancy forecast yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the capacity occupancy forecast are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_CONFIGURE`, `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
zone:
  name: Wave pool deck
  capacity: 900
  forecast13h: 780 (640-910)
```

#### Permissions

- `getForecast` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listOperationalRequirements` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `configureAnomalyDetector` → `AI_CONFIGURE` (configure) · staff
- `listAiInsights` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

### `ADM-512` Entry, Access & Guest Flow Forecast

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getForecast` (AI_USE), `listOperationalRequirements` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Entry and guest-flow forecast: arrivals by 15 minutes per gate, exits, and the lanes needed to keep the gate queue short. The one thing to get right: arrival curves show the morning peak with group arrivals and the share of credentials needing manual validation, which drive lane needs.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **Single unbound table.** Why: Bind to getForecast (subject entryFlow, dimension gate) and gates requirements. *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-512; AI & Intelligence)*

Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it.

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

**Data table** (data table): **Cursor pagination, never offset** — offset drifts under concurrent writes, which on a venue's busiest hour is a list that skips rows.

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **arrivals per gate**: Arrivals per 15 min as a band per gate; lanes required (scans per lane per hour standard) vs lanes planned. *(source: contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#getForecast / contracts/satellite/ai.yaml#listOperationalRequirements (kind gates))*

**Data it reads**: `getForecast` (onLoad, Forecast values); `listOperationalRequirements` (onLoad, Requirements derived from the forecast); `listTenants` (onLoad, The tenant picker: the operator picks a tenant before …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `ADM-509` Operational Forecasting Command Center: *Back to Operational Forecasting Command Center*; carries `tenantId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The entry access guest list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the entry access guest untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No entry access guest yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the entry access guest are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
gate:
  name: Main gate
  peak: 09:45-10:15, 620-840 arrivals
  lanesRequired: 5 (busy case 6)
  lanesPlanned: 4
```

#### Permissions

- `getForecast` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listOperationalRequirements` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `BO-927`: Same rows, labels and decision states.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
row:
  role: Gate staff
  period: Sat 09:00-11:00
  required: 8 (busy case 10)
  scheduled: 6
  drivers: arrivals 2,100, 300 scans/lane/h, 18% manual validation
```

#### Permissions

- `getForecast` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listOperationalRequirements` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `getStaffingCoverage` → `WORKFORCE_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

48 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getForecast` (AI_USE), `listOperationalRequirements` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **This screen's operations return no schema with described properties**, so not one of its columns can be bound. The columns are the pack's own labels and are carried as text until the response shape …

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Frontline service forecast: how many POS counters, flying POS, ticket windows, kiosks, service desks, membership counters and F&B and retail tills need to be open to keep waits acceptable. The one thing to get right: points are rows with required (busy case) vs planned, and the service-level target used is visible.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
outlet:
  name: Lagoon Grill
  covers: 1,150 (900-1,400)
  atRisk: 'Burger buns: forecast use 1,300, on hand 800, lead time 1 day'
```

#### Permissions

- `getForecast` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listOperationalRequirements` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

### `ADM-516` Resource, Equipment & Facility Requirement Forecast

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `getForecast` (AI_USE), `listOperationalRequirements` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Non-workforce resources: carts, lockers, cabanas, towels, buggies, first-aid points, cleaning cycles - what the forecast says will be needed against what exists. The one thing to get right: same requirement rows and labels as the resource screens in Venue Management.

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
columns:
- Base
- +4 staff
- Open lane 5
- Hours 10-19
rows:
  workforceGap:
  - 18
  - 0

  - 25 min
  - 19 min
  posWait:

```

#### Permissions

- `createForecastScenario` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `compareForecastScenarios` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listOperationalRequirements` → `AI_USE` (operate) · staff
- `listTenants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (read) · staff
- `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff
- `openPlatformStaffGrant` → `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS` (operate) · staff · step-up mfa

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

10 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Demand forecasts show current sales pace, forecast and remaining opportunity broken down by sales channel; revenue forecasts show drivers and confidence levels. A forecast simulator models a hypothetical change (e.g. a 10% price decrease, reduced operating hours, staffing changes) before it is made. *(client request · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.10 AI Forecasting — Attendance, Demand, Revenue & Capacity Forecasting · DI-943)*

Also apply: 9 for all of P09, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

### `ADM-518` Operational Forecast Review, Recommendations & Handover

**Consolidate forecast findings into a controlled operational readiness plan and hand recommendations to the appropriate TICVAI modules. This is the final screen of the Forecasting module.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Control · P09 TICVAI Web (web) |
| Module | Analytics · wave 3 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | Block D · task APP-CONSOLE-ADM-518 |
| Who uses it | ticvai staff holding `AI_USE`, `PLATFORM_TENANT_ACCESS`, `PLATFORM_TENANT_VIEW` (2 operate, 1 read); in the flows as platform admin |
| Device and orientation | This is the TICVAI console on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail, a top bar with the tenant switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (compact density): **nothing in the pack chooses a pattern for this screen** — no metric directory, no display directory, no configuration directory. It falls to the default, and the fallback is recorded rather than … |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | `requirementId` (navigation), `tenantId` (navigation) |
| Route | `/analytics/operational-forecast-review-recommendations-handover-adm-518` |

**What the spec says about it.** **Tenant picker and platform-staff grant added 2 October 2026** (CHG-SBO-001; Chinmay, pre-apply round: console screens get the R098 tenant picker and grant, the ADM-412 pattern). The Console runs outside every cell; `listOperationalRequirements` (AI_USE), `decideOperationalRequirement` (AI_USE) are tenant operations, refused 403 to a platform token until a time-boxed, audited grant into the picked tenant is open. The tenant sees the grant and every action under it.

**Known gaps.** **The pack names 20 actions on this screen and the screen declares 0 operations.** Unserved: Critical Board 1 → Board 2 Architecture, BOARD 1, ATTENDANCE, DEMAND & REVENUE FORECASTING, ├── … **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the AI & Intelligence process.** Review and hand-over: the forecast findings consolidated into an operational readiness plan, and each requirement accepted, modified or rejected and handed to its owning module (Workforce, F&B, Inventory, Resources, Access). The one thing to get right: autonomy L2 Prepare - accepting sends a recommendation; a person applies it in the owning module, and the hand-over status is visible.

**Known correction pending (do not draw the wrong version)**

- **The actionBar holds the board's architecture outline as buttons ("BOARD 1", "├── Attendance", "Critical Board 1 → Board 2 Architecture").** Why: Board text, not actions; remove it. *(source: screens/P09-platform-admin-console.yaml#ADM-518; AI & Intelligence)*

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tenant | picker: choose an id | optional | — | — | shows names, sends the id | **Pick a tenant first** (audit R098; decided 2 October 2026, Chinmay: console screens get the tenant picker and grant, CHG-SBO-001). This screen's operations run in that tenant's cell, and a platform … | `Tenant.id` |

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kind | select | — | Staff · POS · Kiosk · Gates · Fnb · Retail · Stock · Resource · Equipment · Facility | `listOperationalRequirements` ?kind |
| Status | select | — | Issued · Accepted · Modified · Rejected · Handed over · Expired | `listOperationalRequirements` ?status |
| From | date and time picker | — | — | `listOperationalRequirements` ?from |
| To | date and time picker | — | — | `listOperationalRequirements` ?to |
| Version | picker: choose a version | — | — | `listOperationalRequirements` ?versionId |
| Status | radio group | — | Onboarding · Active · Suspended · Terminating · Terminated | `listTenants` ?status |
| Plan | picker: choose a plan | — | — | `listTenants` ?planId |

**Form: Open access grant** (modal, opened by *Open access grant*; *Open access grant* calls `openPlatformStaffGrant`, *Cancel* sends nothing)

**Collects what `openPlatformStaffGrant` sends before it is called** (audit R098). Required: `id` (a client UUIDv7, generated silently), `permissions` (tenant permissions only; `AI_USE` preselected for this screen), `reason`, `expiresAt` (at most 8 hours ahead, proposed). Optional: `ticketRef`. Requires step-up: the operator presents a second factor first. The tenant sees the grant and everything done under it. Dismissing sends nothing; the screen behind is unchanged.

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ID `id` | picker: choose an id | required | — | — | shows names, sends the id | Client-generated UUIDv7 for the grant. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Permissions `permissions` | multi-select chips | required | — | SESSION FORCE LOGOUT · USER MANAGE · ROLE MANAGE · PERMISSION GRANT · PERMISSION VIEW · PERMISSION MANAGE · PLATFORM TENANT VIEW · PLATFORM TENANT MANAGE · PLATFORM TENANT TERMINATE · PLATFORM PLAN MANAGE · PLATFORM CELL VIEW · PLATFORM CELL MANAGE …; at … | — | What the operator may do in this tenant while the grant is open. Tenant permissions only; a `PLATFORM_*` value is refused `400`. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Reason `reason` | text area | required | — | min length 3; max length 500 | — | — | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Ticket ref `ticketRef` | text field | optional | — | max length 100 | — | The support case this access serves, where there is one. | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |
| Expires at `expiresAt` | date and time picker | required | — | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | At most 8 hours after opening (proposed, client to correct). | `openPlatformStaffGrant` body |

Errors to draw in the form: 400 Validation failed; 403 Authenticated but not permitted at the requested scope

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Open grant into this tenant** (banner, from `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`): **Always visible while the screen acts on a tenant** (audit R098, the ADM-412 pattern): which tenant, which permissions, why, and the time left to `expiresAt`. At expiry every tenant action is disabled and the screen returns to its grantRequired state; a new need is a new grant. The tenant sees the grant in its own audit log. Found again after a reload with `listOwnPlatformStaffGrants`.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Operator display name | text | — |
| Permissions | list or chips (count when long) | — |

**What each action does** (from the AI & Intelligence process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

**Data it reads**: `listOperationalRequirements` (onLoad, Requirements derived from the forecast); `listTenants` (onLoad, The tenant picker: the operator picks a tenant before …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `ADM-509` Operational Forecasting Command Center: *Back to Operational Forecasting Command Center*; carries `tenantId`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The operational forecast review list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the operational forecast review untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No operational forecast review yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the operational forecast review are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Grant required (`?state=grantRequired`) | **No access into this tenant yet.** A tenant is picked and no platform-staff grant into it is open, so every tenant action is disabled and the screen offers **Open access grant** (`openPlatformStaffGrant`: reason, permissions `AI_USE`, expiry). The same state returns when the grant reaches `expiresAt` (audit R098; CHG-SBO-001). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 The requirement is no longer `issued` (`requirement-not-open`). |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P09 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/6-ticvai-controller/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html`: the client-approved POS, for operator density and components.
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html`: for finish and motion.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-041, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2.

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.

The day-one baseline per kind: `replenishment`, `requisition`, `prepPlan`, `staffing`, `demandForecast` and `scenario` from the baseline forecast (typical attendance from the venue AI settings x the venue-type month curve x the calendar x weather, bookings on hand as a floor); `menuEngineering` ranked by margin with popularity marked learning; `slaTarget` a standard default; `waitTime` people ahead / configured capacity; `upsell` the relationship map and business priority; `segmentation` known guest attributes; `anomaly` the venue's configured thresholds and actual against the forecast's low end; `sendTime` the channel's typical hour; `wasteRisk` shelf life and par against the forecast; `queueBalancing` configured capacity per queue. Only a missing setting refuses (422 `AiMissingSettingProblem`).\n- `price`: unit cost plus the category's target margin, held inside the price band. Minimum: a current cost, no history.\n- `replenishment`: par level minus on-hand plus expected use over the supplier lead time. Minimum: 14 days of stock movements.\n- `requisition`: the next service's prep-plan ingredient needs minus kitchen stock. Minimum: 14 days of sales.\n- `demandForecast`: the average of the same weekday over the last 8 weeks, adjusted by admissions already booked. Minimum: 8 weeks of sales.\n- `prepPlan`: forecast covers for the service times each item's share of the last 4 same weekdays. Minimum: 4 weeks of sales.\n- `menuEngineering`: each item placed by popularity against margin, over 90 days. Minimum: 90 days of sales.\n- `staffing`: forecast demand divided by the role's standard covers per staff hour. Minimum: 8 weeks of sales (the forecast it rests on).\n- `slaTarget`: the 80th percentile of actual times over the last 30 days. Minimum: 30 days of timed events.\n- `waitTime`: people ahead divided by the throughput of the last 30 minutes. Minimum: 30 minutes of throughput today.\n- `upsell`: the item most often bought with the basket's items over 90 days. Minimum: 90 days of orders.\n- `segmentation`: recency, frequency and spend scores over 12 months. Minimum: 90 days of orders.\n- `anomaly`: a value outside three standard deviations of the same weekday over 8 weeks. Minimum: 8 weeks of the measure.\n- `scenario`: the demand forecast re-run with the stated changes. Minimum: as `demandForecast`.\n- `sendTime` (added 29 September): per recipient, the hour inside `context.sendWindow` in which they have most often opened or clicked over the last 90 days (marketing-crm attribution touches), and where `context.channel` is `best`, the consented channel with the highest engagement. A recipient with fewer than three touches gets their segment's modal hour, and one with none the window's start. Asked with `subjectRef` a segment id or `context.subjectIds` (at most 10,000). `value` is `{recommendations: [{subjectId, sendAt, channel, basisTouches}]}`. Minimum: 90 days of message touches at the scope.\n- `wasteRisk` (added 29 September): per item at an outlet or store location, planned production and stock on hand minus forecast demand over the item's shelf life, plus batches expiring inside the horizon (`inventory.listExpiringBatches`). `value` is `{items: [{itemRef, quantityAtRisk, valueAtCost, expiresAt, recommendedAction (reducePrep, promote, transfer, useInRecipe), transferTo}]}`. Minimum: 14 days of recorded waste and of sales.\n- `queueBalancing` (added 29 September): per queue or attraction at `subjectRef` (a venue) over `horizon`, the forecast wait (the `queue` forecast definition) against throughput capacity, a recommended virtual-queue return-slot allocation by queue type, and guest redirection from over-used to under-used attractions. `value` is `{queues: [{queueId, forecastWaitMinutes, capacityPerHour, returnSlotsPerInterval, redirectTo}]}`.
