## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `APPROVAL_REQUEST, AUDIT_VIEW, DEVELOPER_MANAGE, DEVELOPER_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management)

Platform Foundation is everything the apps stand on. Five apps each have one door: the guest app and website (WEB-016, GST-042: a six-digit code to email or mobile, a password, Apple or Google, UAE Pass; never enterprise SSO), the till (POS-000: employee number and PIN, recent operators as tiles; the kitchen display is the same app), the staff handheld and scanner (EMP-001, SCN-001), Venue Management (SUP-001, the single door for the back office P08, the CMS P13, analytics P16 and the support desk P12) and TICVAI Control (ADM-001 for TICVAI's own platform operators, PTR-001 for partner users; the developer portal P14 and the sign-up P17 belong to this app too). A second factor is required by permission, not by role or device: ROLE_MANAGE, LEDGER_APPROVE and every PLATFORM_* permission, plus any the tenant adds; so a cashier never sees it and a platform operator always does. The factor is an authenticator app with an emailed code as fallback; five wrong codes lock step-up for the lockout minutes, never permanently. Guests get two-step verification only at a venue that switched it on. One person holds one session per workstation: a second sign-in is refused and only a supervisor ends the other session. Several roles mean a role prompt; one role goes straight in. The workstation decides the Sale Board, hardware and till identity, never what a person may do. Sensitive actions (refund approval, journal approval, credential reset, partner credit, commission rules, opening a platform-staff grant and 17 more) demand a fresh step-up on the operation itself, asked in place in the action's confirmation; the tenant may raise the strength, never remove it. Permission outcomes are three, never one word: self-authorised (proceeds, audited), escalated (a supervisor PIN in place), refused (the denied state, naming the permission); a missing permission is never an empty table, and a record outside the person's venues is "not found", indistinguishable from absent. The hierarchy is binding (tenant, brand, region, venue, department, sub-department, workstation; outlet beside department for F&B and retail); region owns currency, decimals, time zone, date format and fiscal year; configuration resolves nearest-ancestor across tenant, region and venue (outlet for F&B and retail), venue is the floor and a workstation is assigned a profile, never configured; every configuration screen says which level it writes and what it inherits. Venue Management is one tenant-level surface filtering across the venues in the session's scope. TICVAI's Console runs outside every cell: a platform operator picks a tenant and opens a time-boxed, audited platform-staff grant (with step-up) before any tenant action, and the tenant sees every action in its audit log (ADM-412 is the reference implementation). Approval workflows record authorisations and never perform the action; the requester cannot approve their own request; a venue may tighten and never loosen a rule from above; in-flight …

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it

WHAT THE PROCESS IS. Everything a guest can buy is set up, priced, promoted and serviced here, on Venue Management (P08, the venue's own back office, served inside the venue's cell) and on the TICVAI Console (P09, TICVAI's control plane, outside every cell). End to end: (1) CATALOGUE. A product has one of twelve kinds (admission, timedAdmission, datedAdmission, openDated, seated, membership, bundle, fnb, retail, rental, addOn, giftCard). Its ticket types (adult, child, senior, resident...) are not typed one by one: they are generated from the product's attributes (components) and each value combination becomes a sellable ticket type with no extra setup (DI-164). What a ticket grants (validity, entries, re-entry, days of week, blackout dates, expiry anchor, fast track, transfer) lives on a reusable entitlement template, not on the product. Who may take part (age, height, supervision, certification) is the eligibility rule; what the guest must answer is the data mask and the consent questions; how the guest sees it is guestListing (bookable, infoOnly, hidden), display tags (at most six), media and the booking flow. Group, family and corporate products and every after-sales policy (reschedule, exchange, refund, cancellation, upgrade, transfer) are configured inside the one product configuration, never on separate screens (DI-465, DI-466). (2) LIFECYCLE AND PUBLICATION. A product moves draft, inReview, approved, live, withdrawn, archived. Approval and publication are two acts with two permissions (PRODUCT_APPROVE, PRODUCT_PUBLISH, R091); every product is authorised before it sells online or on site (DI-438). Approved is still not on a till: a till sells only what is in the signed catalogue release it pulled (publishBundle, ADR-0013), so a saved price is a back-office fact until the venue publishes to tills. Changing something that has sold is preceded by an impact check (assessProductChange: orders affected, entitlements issued, future performances, open carts); restoring a version creates a new version, and sold tickets keep the price and terms they were sold under (restoreProductVersion, DI-938, TRACKER Actions row 145). (3) PRICE. Prices live in price lists: per venue, per channel set, with validity dates and a priority, copied for the next season with an uplift (copyPriceList) and repriced in bulk only after a dry run (bulkChangePrices). Currency and decimal scale are never chosen on a form: they resolve from the venue's region (ADR-0008, ADR-0018; AED 2 places, OMR and BHD 3). When several rules apply, the configured hierarchy decides; there is no "lowest price wins" default (DI-595). Tax on the pre-discount price and three-decimal rounding are regional settings (DI-598). Dynamic rules always show their minimum and maximum price guardrails beside the trigger (getDynamicPriceRule). (4) PROMOTE AND BUNDLE. A promotion is a rule (automatic, or gated by a code) created in draft, made live only by Publish, which first analyses stacking; a …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

## Thin screens in this batch

**BO-1071, BO-1072, BO-1073, BO-1074, BO-1075, BO-1076, BO-1077, BO-1078, BO-1080 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `BO-1071` Integration Command Center

**Monitor all seat API and webhook consumers from one place. Show request volume, success, latency, failures, retries, active consumers, versions and security alerts. Compare tenant, venue, application, endpoint, event, environment and time period. Surface deprecated clients, abnormal traffic, delivery backlog and reconciliation failures with owner and action. All writes require authenticated, authorized, idempotent and concurrency-safe requests; events and audit records carry tenant, version and correlation context and are retained under approved policy. Acceptance condition: Authorized users can complete the described task end to end; saved changes are validated, permission-controlled, integrated with the named shared services and traceable in the immutable audit history.**

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management) process.** Monitor seat API and webhook consumers: volume, success, latency, failures.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): emptyFirstRun says it 'carries the create action', and the screen declares no operation that creates anything. (CHG-SBO-002).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Data table** (data table): **Cursor pagination, never offset** — offset drifts under concurrent writes, which on a venue's busiest hour is a list that skips rows.

**Data it reads**: `listApiClients` (onLoad, Integrations connected)

**Where the user goes next**

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The integration list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the integration untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No integration yet. Offers no create action — this screen declares no operation that makes one; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the integration are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
listApiClients (ApiClient):
- name: Kiosk connector (sandbox)
  environment: sandbox

  credentialTtlDays: 12
  expiresAt: 31/12/2026 23:59

- name: OTA availability feed
  environment: production
  issuedBy: ticvai
  credentialTtlDays: 3
  expiresAt: 15/10/2026 00:00

```

#### Permissions

- `listApiClients` → `DEVELOPER_VIEW` (read) · staff, partner

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 1 for P08 · Access & Venue, 24 for all of P08, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

### `BO-1072` Seat Management APIs

**Publish a governed catalog of supported seat endpoints. Document APIs for maps/layouts, availability, locks, holds, reservations, allocations, sales and seat history. Show method, path, version, scope, request/response schema, errors, examples, limits and deprecation date. Provide sandbox testing and prevent production calls until client, scopes and integration approval are active. All writes require authenticated, authorized, idempotent and concurrency-safe requests; events and audit records carry tenant, version and correlation context and are retained under approved policy. Acceptance condition: Authorized users can complete the described task end to end; saved changes are validated, permission-controlled, integrated with the named shared services and traceable in the immutable audit history.**

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process.** The supported seat management APIs for integrators: endpoints, versions, scopes.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): An API catalogue reads seat maps; it should read the published API definitions (developer portal). (CHG-WIR-025).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **API catalogue**: Method, path, version, scope; links to the developer portal. *(source: contracts/satellite/seating.yaml#listSeatMaps)*

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-1071` Integration Command Center: *Back to Integration Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The seat apis list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the seat apis untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No seat apis yet. Offers no create action — this screen declares no operation that makes one; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the seat apis are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Not shown: nothing on this screen needs a permission of its own; the app's sign-in decides access. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
api:
  method: GET
  path: /performances/{id}/seats
  version: v1
```

#### Permissions

**A refused user sees:** Not shown: nothing on this screen needs a permission of its own; the app's sign-in decides access.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): createApiClient on a tenant screen. (CHG-WIR-021).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scopes, by module | multi select | — | — | — | — | **A scope picker grouped by module** (M17-05): `{module}.read` and `{module}.write`, with unlicensed modules shown and disabled rather than hidden. No scope opens a catalogue write (M17-04). | — |

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Module | field | — | — | `listApiScopes` ?module |
| Status | radio group | — | Pending · Approved · Rejected · Withdrawn | `listProductionAccessRequests` ?status |

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Production access** (banner, from `listProductionAccessRequests`): **Where production access stands** (M17-06): sandbox only, requested (pending), approved (a production client issued by TICVAI) or rejected with the reason. Production keys only after certification; a sandbox key is never promoted.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Items | list or chips (count when long) | — |
| ID | the name it points at, never the id | — |

**Data table** (data table): **Cursor pagination, never offset** — offset drifts under concurrent writes, which on a venue's busiest hour is a list that skips rows.

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-1071` Integration Command Center: *Back to Integration Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The api access oauth list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the api access oauth untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No api access oauth yet. Offers no create action — this screen declares no operation that makes one; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the api access oauth are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Can read but not change (holds DEVELOPER_VIEW only)**: Everything reads; the actions needing another permission are not offered as live buttons: DEVELOPER_MANAGE for createApiClient. Where the person would reasonably expect the action, it shows disabled with the permission named. The server refuses with 403 forbidden regardless. *(source: contracts/satellite/public-api.yaml#createApiClient)*
- **createApiClient answers 409**: Show it as something the person can act on, not a failure: A `production` client without a current certification, or asked for by a developer rather than issued by TICVAI (`certification-required`, M17-06). Use `requestProductionAccess`. *(source: contracts/satellite/public-api.yaml#createApiClient)*
- **createApiClient answers 422**: Show it as something the person can act on, not a failure: A `production` client with an empty `ipAllowList` (`ip-allow-list-required`, M17-07), or a scope that is not in the scope catalogue (`unknown-scope`, M17-05). *(source: contracts/satellite/public-api.yaml#createApiClient)*

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
listApiScopes (ApiScope):
- access: read
  description: Guest charged twice at Main Gate Till 3
  licensed: true
- access: write
  description: Group of 40 from Desert Gate Tours
  licensed: false
```

#### Permissions

- `listApiScopes` → `DEVELOPER_VIEW` (read) · public, staff, partner
- `listProductionAccessRequests` → `DEVELOPER_VIEW` (read) · staff, partner
- `listApiClients` → `DEVELOPER_VIEW` (read) · staff, partner

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

1 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13.3.24 | To provide the ability to enable license for the API only for the specific module. Example. APIs are exposed only for ticketing excluding resource management, Seating Module, etc | Developer & API Management | CONTRACTED | `listApiScopes` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Production access status is shown: sandbox only, requested (pending), approved, or rejected with the reason. Production keys only after certification; the request form says a new production key is issued and the sandbox key stays sandbox. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, M17-06 · DI-927)*
- API scopes are picked from a list grouped by module ({module}.read / {module}.write), with unlicensed modules shown disabled rather than hidden; the API reference is grouped by licensable module, then contract. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, M17-05, M17-12 · DI-926)*

### `BO-1075` Seat Event Catalog

**Define the versioned events emitted by the seat platform. Catalog map/layout published, availability changed, seat locked/unlocked, held/released, reserved, sold and blocked events. Show schema, required tenant/venue/performance/seat identifiers, timestamp, version and correlation metadata. Manage backward compatibility, deprecation, sample payload and consumer impact for schema changes. All writes require authenticated, authorized, idempotent and concurrency-safe requests; events and audit records carry tenant, version and correlation context and are retained under approved policy. Acceptance condition: Authorized users can complete the described task end to end; saved changes are validated, permission-controlled, integrated with the named shared services and traceable in the immutable audit history.**

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management) process.** The versioned seat events with their schemas.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): emptyFirstRun says it 'carries the create action', and the screen declares no operation that creates anything. (CHG-SBO-002).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Publisher | text field | — | — | `listWebhookEventTypes` ?publisher |

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Data table** (data table): **Cursor pagination, never offset** — offset drifts under concurrent writes, which on a venue's busiest hour is a list that skips rows.

**Data it reads**: `listWebhookEventTypes` (onLoad, The seat event catalogue (publisher=seating))

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-1071` Integration Command Center: *Back to Integration Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The seat event catalog list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the seat event catalog untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No seat event catalog yet. Offers no create action — this screen declares no operation that makes one; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the seat event catalog are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
listWebhookEventTypes (WebhookEventCatalogueEntry):
- name: Kiosk connector (sandbox)

  description: Guest charged twice at Main Gate Till 3
- name: OTA availability feed

#### Permissions

### `BO-1077` Mapping & Transformation

**Map external partner fields and codes to TICVAI canonical seat entities. Configure source-to-target identifiers, status/category code mapping, value transformation and defaults. Validate data type, required field, tenant/venue context, referential integrity and unsupported values. Provide test payload, expected result, versioning and safe rollback without modifying the canonical model. All writes require authenticated, authorized, idempotent and concurrency-safe requests; events and audit records carry tenant, version and correlation context and are retained under approved policy. Acceptance condition: Authorized users can complete the described task end to end; saved changes are validated, permission-controlled, integrated with the named shared services and traceable in the immutable audit history.

### `BO-1079` Immutable Seat Audit Logs

**Provide searchable tamper-evident evidence for seat data and administrative actions. Record actor/client, tenant, venue, event, entity, action, before/after, reason, source IP/device and timestamp. Store API request/event correlation, rule/version, approval, outcome and related transaction references. Support permission-controlled search and export, retention/legal hold and integrity verification without log alteration. All writes require authenticated, authorized, idempotent and concurrency-safe requests; events and audit records carry tenant, version and correlation context and are retained under approved policy. Acceptance condition: Authorized users can complete the described task end to end; saved changes are validated, permission-controlled, integrated with the named shared services and traceable in the immutable audit history.**

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built. Removed 2 October 2026 (CHG-WIR-025): The only read was the seat reconciliation, not an audit log; the audit view reads listAuditRecords (design-notes correction ticketing-backoffice BO-1079)

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process.** Tamper-evident audit of seat data and administrative actions.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The only read is reconciliation, not an audit log. (CHG-WIR-025); List operation(s) getSeatReconciliation return a bare array, not the paged list envelope (items, nextCursor, hasMore). (CHG-WIR-025).

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce, as the venue and TICVAI configure and run it process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **audit log**: Actor, entity, action, before and after, reason, time. *(source: contracts/satellite/seating.yaml#getSeatReconciliation)*

**Data it reads**: `listAuditRecords` (onLoad, Who did what to seat data, where and when)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-1071` Integration Command Center: *Back to Integration Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The immutable seat audit list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the immutable seat audit untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No immutable seat audit yet. Offers no create action — this screen declares no operation that makes one; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the immutable seat audit are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
event:
  actor: Ticketing manager
  action: seat killed
  seat: Lower 104 K-7
```

#### Permissions

- `listAuditRecords` → `AUDIT_VIEW` (read) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

### `BO-1080` Integration Approval & Compliance

**Govern production activation and ongoing compliance of each integration. Route security review, data classification, privacy, architecture, performance and business-owner approval. Attach sandbox results, contract tests, load/security tests, rollback plan, support ownership and incident contacts. Issue time-bound approval, require periodic review and export a controlled compliance evidence package. All writes require authenticated, authorized, idempotent and concurrency-safe requests; events and audit records carry tenant, version and correlation context and are retained under approved policy. Acceptance condition: Authorized users can complete the described task end to end; saved changes are validated, permission-controlled, integrated with the named shared services and traceable in the immutable audit history.

**Known gaps.** **The pack gives this screen nothing that can be drawn.** Its sections are prose — purpose, acceptance conditions, worked examples — with no directory of metrics, columns or fields anywhere in them. … **The pack gives this screen no display, metric or configuration directory**, so its shape is a default rather than a reading. It needs a person before it is built.

**From the Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management) process.** Approval of an integration's production activation and compliance evidence.

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Create approval request (primary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

**Where the user goes next**

- → `BO-1071` Integration Command Center: *Back to Integration Command Center*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The integration approval compliance list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the integration approval compliance untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No integration approval compliance yet. Carries the create action; distinct from a filter that matched nothing. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | The filter narrowed it and the integration approval compliance are still there. Names the active filter and offers to clear it. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 409 An open request already exists for this subject. Two approvals for one refund is how a refund gets paid twice. (ApprovalStateProblem) |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **A person whose grants cover only some venues, or a link to a record in another venue**: The venue filter lists only venues in the session's scope (Session.scope, resolved at sign-in); a record outside it renders Not found, deliberately indistinguishable from absent, never a 'you may not see venue X' message. *(source: ADR-0011; contracts/shared/common.yaml#/components/schemas/Problem; contracts/spine/identity.yaml#getCurrentSession)*
- **createApprovalRequest answers 409**: Show it as something the person can act on, not a failure: An open request already exists for this subject. Two approvals for one refund is how a refund gets paid twice. `refusedReason` is `openRequestExists` and `requestId` names the open request, so the caller can point at it rather than raise another. A draft is not an open request. *(source: contracts/spine/approvals.yaml#createApprovalRequest)*

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
integration: OTA availability feed
reviews:
  security: approved
  privacy: approved
  business: pending
evidence:
- Sandbox results
- Load test 300 rps
```

#### Permissions

- `createApprovalRequest` → `APPROVAL_REQUEST` (operate) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Names the missing permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

5 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P08 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/5-venue-management/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html`: the client-approved POS, for operator density and components.
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html`: for finish and motion.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-030, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-041, DI-042, DI-043, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051, DI-052 (each is in the design inputs below).

**Workshop tracker rows about P08 as a whole** (1: 1 open, 0 closed). Open first; a closed row says where it went on 30 September.

- **S8** Venue Management back-end configuration wireframes *(Chinmay Parab · In progress · due Fri 2 Oct · 30 Sep 2026 · 30 Sep tracker)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P08 Venue Management

- Qossai: configuration screens should consolidate related functionality, potentially merging 3-4 previously separate screens into one, rather than the repetitive one-screen-per-concept pattern of the AI-built reference system. *(agreed · MoM 24 Sep 2026, 4.5 Screen Consolidation Philosophy · DI-987)*
- **Open question.** Open: should AI monitoring live in one centralised AI command dashboard or be distributed as widgets in each functional module's own dashboard? Allam: Softlabs' call; the current proposal is illustrative and Softlabs may propose a better structure. *(open · MoM 18 Sep 2026, 4.4 AI Governance — Risk, Compliance & Continuous Monitoring · DI-936)*
- Simulation functionality stays embedded within each relevant configuration section rather than being consolidated, since it tests that section's own configuration. *(agreed · MoM 8 Sep 2026, 4.11 Dashboard & Reporting Module Consolidation Strategy · DI-722)*
- Client boards (POS Frontline, F&B, Retail, Inventory & Procurement) share one architecture: six boards of ten screens per domain, a command centre first and an AI/analytics board last, under the hierarchy Company > Venue > Department > Workstation > Operator/Shift > Transaction > Exception > Reconciliation > Analytics. *(agreed · client-design-boards-audit 20 Aug 2026, Opening / What the boards give us · DI-400)*
- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- **Open question.** Allam: a user's visibility must be restrictable to specific outlets (an F&B manager of one outlet should not see other outlets' items); also relevant for ticketing/event-specific access. Implementation approach still open. *(open · MoM 18 Aug 2026, 4.6 Role-Based & Outlet-Level Access Control — Open Item · DI-331)*
- Access loads automatically at login on POS and web/admin. A user with one role logs straight in; a user with several roles (e.g. admin, cashier, supervisor, manager) is prompted to choose which role to use. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 4. Multiple Roles per User and Role Switching · DI-249)*
- Back office is role-driven from any device: a finance user signing in from a workstation, laptop or home sees only finance reports and related information. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 3. Role-Based Access and Workstation-Linked Front-End · DI-248)*
- Built-in help menu with step-by-step tutorials with screenshots for common tasks (e.g. how to sell a ticket at the POS). *(client request · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 8. Legacy POS Layout Designer & System Logging · DI-160)*
- Custom data-capture fields ("data mask") at account, event, extended-ticket and product level: field types text, dropdown, radio, true/false; multi-language labels; validation (min/max length, required/optional); reusable value lists (e.g. country list). Standard fields come out of the box. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 6. Data Mask: Flexible Custom Data Capture · DI-155)*
- Load/traffic dashboards respect the tenancy model: a venue manager sees traffic for their own venue only. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-061)*
- Allam: queue management is built into the system (not third-party) so traffic entering the site can be throttled from the back office itself. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 4. Non-Functional Requirements: Scalability & Availability · DI-060)*
- **Open question.** Proposed tenant hierarchy Tenant > Organization/Brand > Region > Branch > Venue > Department, under review against TICVAI's own organisational hierarchy before finalising. *(open · MoM 30 Jul 2026, 2. Proposed Multi-Tenant Hierarchy · DI-055)*
- Documentation deliverable includes user guides and help content; the preview shows a TICVAI Help Center with categories (Getting Started, Events, Tickets, Orders, Payments, Memberships, Access Control, Reports, Integrations), a "Welcome to TICVAI" getting-started article and Quick Links (Create an Event, Set Pricing, Manage Access, View Reports). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - What We Deliver / Key Deliverables Preview · DI-052)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- AI Assistant panel: a short framing ("Based on last 30 days, here are 3 actions that can improve your revenue") then actionable recommendations, each with its potential impact (e.g. "Increase pricing for VIP seats, +12%") and a chevron, plus "View all recommendations". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - AI Panels · DI-043)*
- Chart cards: title with period dropdown ("This Week"), headline metrics with deltas (Tickets Sold 12,840 +8.7%, Visitors, Conversion). Data visualisations must be easy to read. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Charts · DI-041)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Back-office shell: collapsible left sidebar with Overview, Events, Tickets, Orders, Customers, Memberships, Access Control, POS, Reports, Analytics, AI Assistant, Settings, and the signed-in user (name, role) at the bottom; top bar with global search (Cmd+K), current time and date, Notifications with unread dot, and user menu. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 04 Dashboard Vision (p4) - navigation shell · DI-030)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*
- Reports and historical searches must still retrieve archived transactions when required; the retention period (e.g. keep 3 of 5+ years live) is configurable per customer, archival manual or automated. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 23. Database Optimisation and Archiving · DI-018)*
- Back-office controls for the waiting room: configurable maximum active users and admission intervals, set per customer and venue. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 19. Auto-scaling and Virtual Waiting Room · DI-017)*

### In P08 · Access & Venue

- Accreditation-holder monitoring is a filtered view inside general entitlement monitoring, not a separate system. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, Accreditation (cited in P11 resolvedQuestions) · DI-694)*

**2 more name particular screens** and are in each screen's block above (*Client meeting inputs*).

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.

The tenant default matrix for each of these names the finance approver role; a venue may tighten it and never loosen it. Starting a release rollout routes through `releasePromotion` to the platform release manager (a holder of `PLATFORM_RELEASE_PROMOTE`). **Not every `requiresApproval` goes here:** reopening a shift, recounting a stock count and a retail return above the venue threshold take a supervisor's step-up on the same device instead, and never raise a request.\n**Catalogue change requests route through `productChange` and `pricingChange`** (decided 29 September, writers pass): a product change and a price or pricing change raised in `catalogue` ask for approval under these two kinds, so a venue can route product edits and price edits to different approvers.\n\n**Optional review steps a venue switches on, decided 2 October 2026** (Chinmay; CHG-CSP-036, CHG-CSP-028, CHG-CSP-031).
