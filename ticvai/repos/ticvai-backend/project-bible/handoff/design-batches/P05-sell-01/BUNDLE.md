## Who this is for

**guest on kiosk.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 4 permissions apply here:
  `ORDER_CREATE, ORDER_REPRINT, ORDER_VIEW, PRODUCT_VIEW`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale)

A guest finds something to do, picks when and how many, holds capacity, pays, and receives a ticket they can show at the gate, transfer or resell. The same booking engine serves the guest website (P01, WEB-), the guest app (P02, GST-) and, through the same catalogue, cart and order operations, the kiosk (P05), the cashier at the till (P04) and the staff handheld (P06); partners book on credit through the partner portal (P10). Guest surfaces are white-label (venue logo, colours, fonts, card layouts, step indicator style, cart placement) with "Powered by TICVAI" kept; the till and handheld stay TICVAI-branded. The booking runs in a fixed order that the client set on 29 September and confirmed on 30 September: for a dated product, the date first, then the time (hidden until a date), then the tickets (hidden until a time); undated products go straight to the tickets; product-first flows (workshops) pick the product, then the date; seated events with one performance open on the seat map, sections first, zoom into a section, pinch out to compare. Choosing a date, time or session commits nothing; capacity is held only when a quantity is set (a 15-minute basket window, 8 minutes for seats and cabanas, one extension). The guest counters (adult, child, senior, infant, person of determination) belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices, so a basket line is "<ticket> · <guest type> × <n>"; group and school products start from group ticket cards and a typed headcount (minus, plus, and +10 on the app), supervisors free. Help me choose filters the catalogue on the server (never a consent step) with Show everything; consent questions such as "Are you able to swim?" are asked once after the session is picked and never again where the page already asked. Sign-in or the six-digit guest code is asked when the guest leaves Add-ons (or at payment, per venue), only the fields the venue configured; after the code, only the T&Cs tick remains (W1). Payment creates the order first and treats an unknown outcome as "checking with your bank", never a second charge; tickets issue on payment, go to Apple or Google Wallet, and a dynamic-QR event's ticket lives in the app. The guest app is deliberately not a copy of the website (30 September): its structure is Home, Explore, Plan and Tickets tabs with a persistent Buy tickets button, item pages that propose the right product (a restaurant's meal combo that includes admission), ride videos that play with no loader, a visit planner that plans each day at one park from that park's rides, dining and shops only, and in-park walking navigation; the booking flow inside it is functionally identical to the web. Vocabulary in guest copy follows the glossary's recorded exceptions (Booking, Session, QR). source: [F01, F02, F03, F07, F49, F52, F55, F57, F58, F59, MoM 29 Sep 1 (W1-W12), MoM 29 Sep 2, MoM 29 Sep 3, MoM 30 Sep 4.4-4.8, CLIENT-RESPONSE-30SEP 1-6, CLIENT-RESPONSE-REV3-25SEP, REV3-1, REV3-2, REV3-3, REV3-4, REV3-26, DI-1086 …

### White Label & CMS

A tenant (one operator, one or many venues) brands and arranges its own guest surfaces, the guest web (P01), the guest app (P02) and the kiosk (P05), from the Venue CMS (P13, a section of the Venue Management app), and TICVAI platform staff can do the same from the console (P09 ADM-016..018) only under a time-boxed grant into the tenant. Everything is configuration over a fixed structure: the guest flow, the page structure and the components are TICVAI's and stay the same for every tenant; the tenant chooses graphics, colours, fonts, which modules and tabs appear, the order of homepage sections and booking steps within allowed limits, copy in each language, and its domain. It never adds components. Work happens in ONE working draft per tenant; nothing a guest sees changes until a person with TENANT_PUBLISH publishes the draft as an immutable version (with a note), and a rollback is restore into the draft, review the diff, then publish, never one click. Three things are deliberately outside the draft and take effect at once: the live app status (maintenance, minimum app version, contact, sold out or closed), a venue's Help me choose publish, and policies (each save is a new version). Build-time parts (app icons, native splash, custom font files, wallet and payment integrations) reach guests only with a new store build, which the client publishes under its own Apple and Google accounts (CMS-104). Staff surfaces (POS, scanner, staff app, kitchen display) never take tenant branding; every guest surface carries the "Powered by TICVAI" credit, a toggle that is on by default (decided 2 October 2026, CHG-NOTE-009; DI-297 amended). Arabic is a first-class layout: enabling `ar` requires an Arabic font, the whole layout mirrors (numbers, times, codes and logos do not), and every authored text is a per-language value. The step-based Site Builder (CMS-102) walks a new tenant through seven steps from a venue-type preset so that a logo, four colours and a publish are enough for a working site in about 30 minutes; every step opens the full screen for its details. Vocabulary below; the element-by-element model follows; inputToOutput at the end gives worked examples.

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |

## Thin screens in this batch

**KSK-001, KSK-002, KSK-003, KSK-004, KSK-005, KSK-006, KSK-007, KSK-008, KSK-009, KSK-010 declare fewer than four components.** There is not enough here to build them faithfully. Build what is declared and say what is missing — **an invented screen comes back looking finished**, which is worse than an honest gap.

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `KSK-001` Attract Loop

**Pull somebody standing in a queue out of it.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 1 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | Block A · ticket #28168 (APP-KIOSK-KSK-001) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (touchLarge density): **the screen's operations choose no pattern** — no list, no get, no write that groups. It falls to the default, and the fallback is recorded rather than passed off as a decision |
| Offline | **Not available.** An unattended terminal selling from a stale catalogue oversells with nobody watching |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/sell/attract-loop` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written. **The attract loop is the entry.** A kiosk has no login and nobody navigates to it — it is what the screen shows when nobody is standing there. **Declared 20 August** — `isEntryPoint` existed in the schema and five platforms used none, so every screen in them read as unreachable.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** The kiosk's attract loop: what the screen shows when nobody is standing there, to pull a guest out of the ticket queue. After Block A. Kiosks are guest-facing and white-labelled to the client's brand with a kiosk-specific layout, "Powered by TICVAI" kept.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The screen declares no operation; nothing fills the loop. (CHG-R1S-022).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kind | select | — | Admission · Timed admission · Dated admission · Open dated · Seated · Membership · Bundle · Fnb · Retail · Rental · Add on · Gift card | `listProducts` ?kind |
| Is sellable | toggle | — | — | `listProducts` ?isSellable |
| Category | picker: choose a category | — | — | `listProducts` ?categoryId |
| Segment tag | text field | — | max length 120 | `listProducts` ?segmentTag |
| Guided answers | multi-picker: choose guided answers | — | at most 10 | `listProducts` ?guidedAnswerIds |

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**What's on** (card list, from `listProducts`): Published products only, primary media first; a touch opens the language choice (CHG-R1S-022).

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | — |
| Media | list or chips (count when long) | The product's own photos and video (decided 29 September, 23SEP-4). *Read more* opens on the `isPrimary` item, and a listing shows each … |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **loop content**: The venue's product clips (6 to 12 s, no audio) and "Touch to buy tickets" in English and Arabic; a short line for collecting an online booking. *(source: DI-298; DI-297; DI-1080; F07 step 1)*

**What each action does** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Touch anywhere**: Language choice, then What are you buying (KSK-003). *(source: F07 step 1-3)*

**Data it reads**: `listProducts` (onLoad, Fill the loop with the venue's products and their media)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-002` Language Select: *Chooses a language*
- → `KSK-003` What are you buying: *What are you buying*
- → `KSK-004` Choose tickets: *Choose tickets*; carries `productId`
- → `KSK-014` Out of service: *Out of service*
- → `KSK-015` Assistant: *Opens Assistant*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Not applicable — the attract loop is the idle state |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Falls through to KSK-014 if the kiosk cannot reach the server |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | Not applicable |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **Not available.** An unattended terminal selling from a stale catalogue oversells with nobody watching |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 A `categoryId` that names no category of the venue, or a `guidedAnswerIds` entry that is not an answer of the venue's published guided choice (W4, 29 … |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Offline or the catalogue is stale**: Out of service (KSK-014), never a cached sale. *(source: screens/P05-guest-kiosk.yaml#KSK-001 states.offline)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-004`: Same product media and the no-loader rule.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
loop:
- 'Summit Coaster clip · ''Skip the queue: buy here'''
- Aqua Park Day Pass from AED 245
```

#### Permissions

- `listProducts` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner

#### Requirements it meets

12 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The module and platform inputs below are applied.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.

### `KSK-002` Language Select

**Ask the only question that changes everything else.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `core` module |
| Block | Block B · ticket #29643 (APP-KIOSK-KSK-002) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | statusTracker (touchLarge density): `getTenantAppStatus` reads one record and nothing reads a population — the screen is about that one thing |
| Offline | **From the cached configuration.** The languages the kiosk last read stay on screen; buying waits for the connection. |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/sell/language-select` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written.

**Known gaps.** Replaced by `getPublishedTenantConfig`, the guest read of the same data.

**From the White Label & CMS process.** The kiosk's first question: which language. The kiosk is guest-facing and wears the tenant's brand in a kiosk layout; the choice flips the whole kiosk to that language and direction for this guest only, and resets when the session times out.

**Contract gap logged** (the fix needs an operation or field the contracts do not have yet; draw the corrected version and mark what waits on the contract, as the open change entry says)

- AccessibilitySettings (on TenantConfig.accessibility) has no operation that sets it. (CHG-SGU-024)

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): emptyNoAccess cites TENANT_CONFIGURE; offline says "Not available". (CHG-GST-004).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Choose your language | group | optional | — | — | — | One large button per published language (`languages`), each in its own script; the right-to-left ones lay the kiosk out right to left. From the cached configuration when the kiosk is offline. | `PublishedTenantConfig.languages` |

**Rules for these inputs** (from the White Label & CMS process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Language**: Large touch targets (at least 44 px, touchLarge density), one per enabled language written in its own script, the default first; an accessibility button beside them (large text, high contrast, reachable height). *(source: DI-298; contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/AccessibilitySettings; screens/_design-tokens.yaml)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Closed for maintenance** (banner, from `getTenantAppStatus`): Only when `isInMaintenance`: the tenant's message and expected-back time, and nothing can be bought.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Is published | yes / no (icon or chip) | True once any version has been published. |
| Published version | text | — |
| Published at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Draft version | text | Staff only. |
| Has unpublished changes | yes / no (icon or chip) | Staff only. The working draft differs from the current version's `snapshot`. |
| Active module count | 1,234 | Staff only. `ModuleEnablement` rows with `isEnabled` true. |
| Licensed module count | 1,234 | Staff only. `ModuleEnablement` rows with `isLicensed` true. |
| Active page count | 1,234 | Staff only. Content pages that are `published` and enabled. |
| Is in maintenance | yes / no (icon or chip) | — |
| Maintenance message | in the reader's language | — |
| Expected back at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | — |
| Minimum app version | grouped details | The oldest guest app build still allowed to run (decided 28 September, audit R073). |
| Ios | text | — |
| Android | text | — |
| Contact | grouped details | How a guest reaches the venue: WEB-028 Contact & Venue Information, and the screen shown on an error or when the app cannot help (decided … |
| Phone | +971 50 123 4567 | — |
| Email | email, tap to write | — |
| Whatsapp | text | — |
| Address | in the reader's language | — |
| Opening hours | in the reader's language | Prose, as the guest reads it. The bookable hours are the catalogue's. |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the White Label & CMS process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Brand**: Tenant logo, theme and fonts; Powered by TICVAI at the foot. *(source: DI-298; DI-297)*

**Data it reads**: `getTenantAppStatus` (onLoad, App status and recent changes); `getPublishedTenantConfig` (onLoad, The published languages and branding the kiosk renders in …)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-003` What are you buying: *Chooses buy or collect*
- → `KSK-004` Choose tickets: *Choose tickets*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The language select, read by `getTenantAppStatus`. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the language select untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No language select yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | **From the cached configuration.** The languages the kiosk last read stay on screen; buying waits for the connection. |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **Session idle**: Back to the attract loop (KSK-001) and the default language; timeouts multiplied by sessionTimeoutMultiplier. *(source: contracts/satellite/white-label.yaml#/components/schemas/AccessibilitySettings)*

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
buttons:
- English
- العربية
- Русский
```

#### Permissions

- `getTenantAppStatus` → no permission · device, guest, staff
- `getPublishedTenantConfig` → no permission · anonymous, guest, device

**A refused user sees:** **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**Specific to this screen** (the tenant's setting is the input; the right column is what it changes here). Draw each with its default, and the alternate where the alternate theme sets one.

*Availability and maintenance*, set in `CMS-001` Tenant Workspace:

| Setting | Allowed values | Default | What it changes here |
|---|---|---|---|
| Availability and maintenance message (`maintenance.message`) | English and Arabic (Arabic right to left) | — | — |
| Expected back at (`maintenance.expectedBackAt`) | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 (venue time zone) | — | — |
| Minimum app version: ios (`maintenance.minimumAppVersion.ios`) | pattern `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` | — | — |
| Minimum app version: android (`maintenance.minimumAppVersion.android`) | pattern `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` | — | — |
| Contact: phone (`maintenance.contact.phone`) | +971 5X XXX XXXX (E.164) | — | — |
| Contact: email (`maintenance.contact.email`) | name@example.ae | — | — |
| Contact: address (`maintenance.contact.address`) | English and Arabic (Arabic right to left) | — | — |
| Contact: opening hours (`maintenance.contact.openingHours`) | English and Arabic (Arabic right to left) | — | Prose, as the guest reads it. The bookable hours are the catalogue's. |
| Availability (`maintenance.availability`) | Open · Sold out · Closed | Open | The sold-out or closed signal (decided 28 September, audit R073). `open` is the normal state. |
| Availability message (`maintenance.availabilityMessage`) | English and Arabic (Arabic right to left) | — | — |

Also set there, as content the tenant writes: is in maintenance, minimum app version, contact, contact: whatsapp.

### `KSK-003` What are you buying

**Get to a product in one touch.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block B · ticket #29657 (APP-KIOSK-KSK-003) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (touchLarge density): `listProducts` reads a population and nothing reads one of them; the detail is the row until a `get` exists |
| Offline | Not available |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/sell/what-are-you-buying` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** What are you buying: one touch to a product, or to Collect a booking, or Order food. After Block A. Large tiles a gloved or wet hand can hit; Help me choose answers filter the same way as web and app.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Raw filters "Venue id", "Kind", "Is sellable". (CHG-GST-003).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Filter | Drawn as | Default | Allowed values, rules | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kind | select | — | Admission · Timed admission · Dated admission · Open dated · Seated · Membership · Bundle · Fnb · Retail · Rental · Add on · Gift card | `listProducts` ?kind |
| Is sellable | toggle | — | — | `listProducts` ?isSellable |

| Segment tag | text field | — | max length 120 | `listProducts` ?segmentTag |
| Guided answers | multi-picker: choose guided answers | — | at most 10 | `listProducts` ?guidedAnswerIds |

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**What would you like?** (card list, from `listProducts`): The venue is the one the guest picked on Home (`venueId` from the session, audit R267), never typed. Was the generated table 'Every product'; staff and plumbing columns removed (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-3)).

| Shows | Format | Notes |

| Display tags | list or chips (count when long) | Short facts a guest reads on the ticket card and under *Read more*: *2 Hours*, *Min 1.10 m*, *Free adult entry*, *Valid 90 days*, *Emirates … |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **tiles**: Category tiles with image and from-price; Collect my booking as its own tile; at most two levels before a product. *(source: F07 step 3; screens/P05-guest-kiosk.yaml#KSK-003 transitions; contracts/spine/catalogue.yaml#searchCatalogue (guidedAnswerIds "web, mobile and kiosk show the same list for the same answers"))*

**Data it reads**: `listProducts` (onLoad, List products)

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-006` Review: *They review the basket*; calls `listProducts`
- → `KSK-011` Collect a booking: *Collect a booking*
- → `KSK-016` Order Food: *Order Food*
- → `KSK-004` Choose tickets: *Chooses tickets and quantities*; carries `productId`; calls `listProducts`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The what are you list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the what are you untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No what are you yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Never shown: the kiosk sends no filter a guest chose; the venue is the kiosk's. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor.

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-002`: Same products and filter results.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
tiles:
- Day passes · from AED 245
- Fast Track · from AED 75
- Collect my booking
- Order food
```

#### Permissions

- `listProducts` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission.

#### Requirements it meets

12 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

### `KSK-004` Choose tickets

**Choose the tickets first, then the date and time: quantities, with targets a gloved hand can hit.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block B · ticket #29658 (APP-KIOSK-KSK-004) |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | listDetail (touchLarge density): `listProductVariants` reads the population and `getAvailability` reads one of them — list, select, act |
| Offline | Not available |
| Opens with | `productId` (deepLink) · cold entry: **A shared product link after the product retired.** Shows what replaced it where a successor exists, and the catalogue where none does. |
| Route | `/sell/choose-tickets` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written. **Tickets first, then date and time (decided by Chinmay, 2 October 2026; DEC-170).** The kiosk differs from the web and the app, which pick the date and time first (REV3-2); REV3-2 is superseded for the kiosk only. The order is KSK-003, KSK-004 (tickets), KSK-005 (session), as F07 already walks it (CHG-SGU-015).

**Known gaps.** **`getAvailability` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Choose tickets and quantities with large steppers. After Block A. Same pricing model as the web: the guest types belong to the chosen ticket and take its prices; purchase limits stop the plus button.

**Contract gap logged** (the fix needs an operation or field the contracts do not have yet; draw the corrected version and mark what waits on the contract, as the open change entry says)

- Availability is bound to getAvailability's inline response with no schema. (CHG-SGU-024)

#### Decided on this screen

Answered questions: draw the decision, not the old default. Where a decision and the tables below differ, the decision wins.

- **Does the kiosk follow date, then time, then tickets like web and app?** → The kiosk keeps tickets first, then date and time (unlike web and app). Supersedes REV3-2 for the kiosk only. *(decided by Chinmay, 2026-10-02; DEC-170 / CHG-NOTE-007 / CHG-SGU-015)*

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

| Performance | picker: choose a performance | — | — | `getAvailability` ?performanceId |

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **quantities**: Steppers at least 64 px; plus disabled at the channel's purchase limit with the reason ("Up to 6 tickets per purchase"). *(source: DI-464; DI-172; DI-1106)*
- **Order of steps**: Tickets first, then date and time: the kiosk differs from web and app (REV3-2 is superseded for the kiosk only). *(source: decided 2 October 2026 by Chinmay (CHG-NOTE-007))*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Tickets** (card list, from `listProductVariants`): Large counters per ticket type; inactive variants never shown. Was the generated table 'Every product variant'; staff and plumbing columns removed (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-3)).

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Name | text | Taken from their variant tables, 20 September. `axisValues` gives `{size: L}` and no string a guest can read. |
| Description | in the reader's language | Who this ticket type is for and what it includes, shown behind the (i) on each Adult, Child, Senior or Infant row (decided 29 September … |

**Availability** (data table, from `getAvailability`): Shows `channelCapacityId`, `performanceId`, `capacity`, `sold`, `leased`, `remaining`, `byChannel` from `getAvailability`'s inline response. **The response has no named schema**, so this cannot bind until the contract names one.

| Shows | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Items | list or chips (count when long) | — |
| Channel capacity | the name it points at, never the id | — |
| Performance | the name it points at, never the id | The performance this channel capacity belongs to (`ChannelCapacity.performanceId`), so rows for several performances can be told apart. |
| Starts at | 1 Oct 2026, 14:30 | The performance's start, so a time tile and its day part (morning, afternoon, evening, split at the venue's … |
| Capacity | 1,234 | — |

| Leased | 1,234 | Held by terminals but not yet sold. |
| Remaining | 1,234 | — |
| By channel | list or chips (count when long) | Per-channel position. A guest seeing sold out online while units remain at the counter is correct behaviour, not a defect. |
| Channel | chip: POS, Kiosk, Web, Mobile, B2B, Ota… | — |

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-005` Choose a performance: *Chooses a session*
- → `KSK-015` Assistant: *Assistant*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The choose tickets list. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the choose tickets untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No choose tickets yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Never shown: `listProductVariants` takes no filter, so an empty list is always the first-run state above. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | Not available |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-005`: Same one-line-per-ticket rule.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
lines:
- Day Pass · Adult × 2 · AED 490
- Day Pass · Child × 1 · AED 165
```

#### Permissions

- `getAvailability` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner
- `listProductVariants` → `PRODUCT_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission.

#### Requirements it meets

14 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Quantity/purchase limits can be set per order, per guest, per account category and per sales channel (e.g. maximum 6 tickets per transaction). *(client request · MoM 25 Aug 2026, 4.8 Eligibility Rules, Special Products & Memberships · DI-464)*
- Minimum/maximum sellable quantity per customer (e.g. a promotional bundle requiring at least two) must be enforced at selection. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 16. Entitlement Components: Re-entry, Expiration & Sale Restrictions · DI-172)*

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

### `KSK-005` Choose a performance

**Pick a time that still has room.**

| | |

| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block C · task APP-KIOSK-KSK-005 |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |

| Offline | Not available |
| Opens with | `cartId` (navigation) |
| Route | `/sell/choose-a-session` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written.

**Known gaps.** **`getAvailability` declares its response inline**, so the component that shows it names fields but binds to no schema. The contract should name the shape.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Pick a session that still has room. After Block A. Onsite sales stay open to sell-out or the venue's cutoff (e.g. 15 minutes before a timed show).

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): "Acquire inventory hold" as the primary button. (CHG-GST-003).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Filters and search the reads accept** (draw the ones a person would use; the rest are set by the screen)

**Shown**

**Availability** (data table, from `getAvailability`): Shows `channelCapacityId`, `performanceId`, `capacity`, `sold`, `leased`, `remaining`, `byChannel` from `getAvailability`'s inline response. **The response has no named schema**, so this cannot bind until the contract names one.

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-010`: Same lines.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

#### Requirements it meets

11 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Custom fields gate purchase where configured — e.g. a checkbox confirming a guest is not pregnant before a specific product can be bought, or a weight-range field for an activity. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 6. Data Mask: Flexible Custom Data Capture · DI-156)*

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

- [ ] Every output is drawn (31 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#KSK-006?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.

- [ ] Every transition is wired: `KSK-007`, `KSK-008`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 1 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

### `KSK-007` Payment

**Take a card, and nothing else.**

| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |

| Route | `/sell/payment` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written. **Card only. No foreign cash** — a kiosk accepting foreign notes needs a note reader and a per-currency float, and neither is specified. A guest paying by card in a foreign currency is converted by their own issuer, which is not our rate. **Card only. No foreign cash** — a kiosk accepting notes needs a note reader and a per-currency float, and neither is specified. Dynamic currency conversion by the terminal is recorded as `fxRateSource: cardScheme`, because that rate is the scheme's rather than ours. **The guest selects the currency and pays in it** (decided 2 October 2026, Chinmay; CHG-FIN-001; reverses the display-only rule, CF-37 and "payment will be processed in AED", in favour of option (b) of MoM 10 Aug 2026 4.7, DI-211). The venue lists the currencies a guest may pay in (`VenueSettings.chargeCurrencies`, a subset of the currencies it shows); `listFxRates` with `chargeable=true` returns them, each marked `chargeable`. The selected currency is sent at checkout (`checkoutCart.chargeCurrency`), the rate is locked on the order (`Order.chargeFxRate`, `chargeTotal`, until `chargeRateLockedUntil`), and the payment request goes to the payment partner in that currency. The ledger stays in the venue's base currency, with the rate recorded on the order, the payment and any refund. **Refunds go back in the currency paid**, at the sale rate, so a full refund returns exactly what was charged. A currency the venue shows but does not charge is still an approximate price …

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Payment by card (tap with Apple Pay or Google Pay included) at the attached terminal, and nothing else: no cash, no foreign notes. After Block A.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): The screen lays out eight raw CreatePaymentRequest text fields (id, orderId, tender, amount, tenderedAmount, walletAuthorisationId … (CHG-GST-003).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Tap, insert or scan to pay** (payment terminal, from `createPayment`): The amount due and the card terminal's prompt. The kiosk and the terminal fill the payment (`createPayment`): order, tender, amount and device are never typed. Card only (F75 step 5).

- Flow F07 branch at step 7 (recoverable): when Payment declined, Returns to KSK-007 with the reason. The lease is held for the remaining window rather than released immediately — a guest fumbling for a second card should not lose their session.
- Flow F75 branch at step 5 (high): when The payment does not resolve., `KSK-008` holds it and calls `inquirePaymentStatus` rather than retrying. **An unattended machine that retries a payment charges twice**, and nobody is there to notice.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (0), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (402, 409).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (20 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#KSK-007?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, emptyNoAccess, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Create payment, Cancel.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `KSK-008`, `KSK-009`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The 2 client meeting input(s) for this screen are applied; open questions are built to their default.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.

### `KSK-008` Payment unresolved

**Handle the state that has nobody standing next to it.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Guest · P05 Guest Kiosk (kiosk) |
| Module | Sell · wave 2 · needs the `ticketing` module |
| Block | Block C · task APP-KIOSK-KSK-008 |
| Who uses it | a guest, signed in or not (a guest holds no permission; ADR-0025); in the flows as guest |
| Device and orientation | This is a portrait touch kiosk, 1080 x 1920, large touch targets, no keyboard, an attract screen when idle. · LTR and RTL · the venue's theme |
| Pattern | statusTracker (touchLarge density): `inquirePaymentStatus` asks the provider what became of one payment; the screen shows the answer, it edits nothing (CHG-R1S-022) |

| Route | `/sell/payment-unresolved` |

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Payment unresolved, with nobody standing next to the guest. After Block A. Check with the bank, show the order reference, and call staff; never charge again.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): inquirePaymentStatus declares no request body, so the screen's editor has nothing to edit. (CHG-R1S-022).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

Nothing to enter: the screen reads and acts, and every action sends what the screen already holds.

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Check the payment again (primary button) | `inquirePaymentStatus` POST `/payments/{paymentId}/inquiry` | — | Payment | 404 The resource does not exist, or is outside the caller's scope. This includes a parent in the path. | — |
| Cancel (secondary button) | navigation or local | — | — | — | — |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **message**: "We're checking your payment. Please don't pay again." with the reference and Call staff. *(source: F57 step 2-4)*

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-010` Print failure: *Or it resolves and the printer fails*; carries `orderId`; calls `inquirePaymentStatus`

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The saved payment unresolved. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the payment unresolved untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No payment unresolved configured. The form opens empty and `inquirePaymentStatus` saves the first one; it says what the platform does in the meantime. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | Not applicable |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
message: We're checking your payment of AED 655. Please don't pay again. Reference YAS1-000512.
```

#### Permissions

- `inquirePaymentStatus` → `ORDER_CREATE` (operate) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013).

### `KSK-009` Ticket issued

**Get the ticket into the guest’s hand.**

**What the spec says about it.** Definition derived from the wireframe board on 14 August. Components, states and operations still to be written.

**Known gaps.** A transfer changes the tickets' owner; at a kiosk the guest is resending or printing their own tickets, which is `reprintOrder` by email, SMS or print.

**From the Ticketing & Guest Commerce (guest web, guest app, kiosk, partner portal, POS ticket sale) process.** Ticket issued: take the printed ticket (or, for a dynamic-QR event, the instructions to link it in the app). After Block A.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): "Transfer order tickets" is the primary action. (CHG-GST-003).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**Form: Send to my phone** (modal, opened by *Send to my phone*; *Send to my phone* calls `reprintOrder`, *Back* sends nothing)

**Email or SMS, then the address.** `reprintOrder` with `delivery` email or sms for this order's tickets; nobody else becomes their owner.

**Where the user goes next**

- → `KSK-013` Call staff: *Something goes wrong and they call staff*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The ticket issued, read by `getOrder`. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the ticket issued untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No ticket issued yet. **Offers no create action** — this screen declares no operation that makes one — and says so rather than showing an empty table. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor.

| Offline (`?state=offline`) | Not applicable |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed |

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `WEB-013`: Same order number.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
order: YAS1-000512 · 3 tickets printed
```

#### Permissions

- `reprintOrder` → `ORDER_REPRINT` (operate) · staff, guest, partner, device
- `getOrder` → `ORDER_VIEW` (read) · staff, guest, partner

**A refused user sees:** **A kiosk holds no permission and needs none** (decided by Chinmay, fix before Block A starts, 2 October 2026 (GFIX-4)): it sells to whoever is standing at it, and reads what the tenant has published like any visitor. A kiosk whose device registration is revoked goes out of service (KSK-014); it never shows a sign-in or names a permission.

#### Requirements it meets

10 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

#### Client meeting inputs

None names this screen.

Also apply: 2 for P05 · Sell, 9 for all of P05, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

#### Configurable by the tenant

This is a white-label guest screen: it is drawn in the venue's brand, never TICVAI's (except the *Powered by TICVAI* credit, a tenant toggle that is on by default: `brand.showPoweredBy`). It has no dark or light mode: the venue's theme applies on every device setting. Draw it with the **default theme**, and on the key screens one **alternate tenant theme** (`handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`).

**Shell-wide, on every guest screen:** Brand (11, CMS-002, CMS-004, CMS-104); Theme (27, CMS-005, ADM-016); Fonts (5, CMS-003); Header (5, CMS-009); Navigation (17, CMS-009); Footer (website) (15, CMS-009); Languages and right-to-left (2, CMS-011, ADM-018); Modules shown to guests (3, CMS-001, ADM-424); Features (3, CMS-001); Custom domain (website) (3, CMS-017, ADM-017); SEO metadata (website) (13, CMS-013). Each element, its CMS field, allowed values and default: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

#### Acceptance for the design

- [ ] Every input above is drawn (6), with its required mark, default, format and its error state (400).
- [ ] Every output is drawn (0 fields) with realistic seeded data in the format given (AED, dates, names, never ids).
- [ ] Every state opens from `#KSK-010?state=<state>`: loading, error, emptyFirstRun, offline.
- [ ] Every action is wired with its success and its failure: Send to my phone.
- [ ] Every transition is wired: `KSK-013`.
- [ ] Sign-in is asked only where the spec asks for it.
- [ ] The module and platform inputs below are applied.
- [ ] Drawn in the default theme; on a key screen also in the alternate tenant theme; nothing hard-codes a brand colour, logo or font.
- [ ] Nothing in this specification appears on the screen as text (no ids, field names or permission keys).

## Tenant configuration on every guest screen

Every guest screen in this batch is white-label. These elements are set by the tenant in the CMS and apply to every screen of the guest app (each screen's block lists the ones particular to it). **Draw with the default theme; on the key screens add one alternate tenant theme** (below), so a reviewer sees the brand is configuration, not paint. The full map, with the input-to-output examples: `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/WHITE-LABEL.md`.

**The alternate tenant theme (Coastal Aqua)**: Primary colour #0077B6; Secondary colour #023E8A; Accent colour #FFB703; Background colour #F5FAFC; Text colour #0B1324; Corner radius 18; Surface style Solid; Button style Pill; Logo variant Duotone; Header layout Logo centre; Step indicator Dots; Card layout Cards across; Card size Standard; Cart layout Floating icon; Fonts Poppins / Tajawal.
**Key screens to show in it:** `WEB-001`, `WEB-005`, `WEB-006`, `WEB-010`, `WEB-012`, `GST-001`, `GST-007`, `GST-041`, `KSK-002`, `KSK-003`.

**Decided for every guest screen:** **No dark or light mode.** The venue's chosen theme applies on every device setting; `Theme.darkMode` is deprecated and ignored, never drawn, and the guest app has no Light/Dark switch (Chinmay, 2 October, Q150; CHG-CSA-035). ***Powered by TICVAI* is a tenant toggle, on by default** (`brand.showPoweredBy`): shown on the launch screen, at the foot of Account and in the web footer; switching it off needs the licence add-on, or 403 `powered-by-locked` (Chinmay, 2 October, Q160; DI-297; CHG-CSA-036). **Each homepage section sets its card count and its scroll animation** (`maxItems`; `scrollAnimation` rise, scale, slide, blur or none, default rise): every customisation option of the approved wireframe (Chinmay, 2 October, Q152 and Q153; DI-1088; CHG-CSA-040). **Landing-page templates.** A tenant with no landing page of its own starts from a TICVAI template (`listLandingPageTemplates`, kept as `HomepageLayout.templateKey`); one with its own site links in with deep links (`landingSource` ownSite) (Chinmay, 2 October, batch 2 #41; CHG-CSA-037).

**Never configurable:** A dark or light mode: the guest surfaces have one theme, the venue's (Chinmay, 2 October; CHG-CSA-035). Semantic colour pairs (success, warning, danger, neutral) are not overridable: a tenant who recolours danger to their brand green has made a destructive confirmation look like a success (`screens/_design-tokens.yaml` whiteLabel). Site structure and the navigation flow are fixed and adapt to the product configuration (MoM 3 Aug, DI-119); a guest always books a product or package, never a resource (DI-502). A colour pair that fails 4.5:1 contrast is refused by the CMS, not warned (setTheme 400 ContrastProblem, audit R139).

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P05 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/1-guest-app/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/guest-rev3-30-september/TICVAI Guest Booking v2.dc.html`: the newest client-approved guest look. The kiosk is the same product, narrower.
- `wireframes/reference/Kiosk Board 1.dc.html`: the client's kiosk board, for layout (and Kiosk Board 2).

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-038, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

**Workshop tracker rows about P05 as a whole** (6: 0 open, 6 closed). Open first; a closed row says where it went on 30 September.

- **A54** Design centralized, venue-level inventory model with an inter-venue stock-transfer workflow, ensuring sales across web/mobile/kiosk/POS channels all draw from the same system-recorded stock (not physical stock) per venue *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker)*
- **A56** Confirm and implement branding rules across surfaces: TICVAI branding (with "Powered by TICVAI") on staff-facing POS/tablet devices, and white-labeled, client-branded UI on guest-facing kiosks *(Softlabs Design Team · Medium · Done → 30 Sep: Closed, Done (as recorded earlier) · workshop tracker)*
- **A192** Design a single-matrix channel-and-variant pricing view (adult/child × onsite/online/kiosk), benchmarked against the referenced competitor tool *(Softlabs Design Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Rolled into S9 (final UI/UX) · 31 Aug 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A226** Build facial recognition in two tiers (Face Pass for memberships, Face Tag for single visits) with enrolment via app, web, POS, kiosk or turnstile, plus re-enrolment and fallback media *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 2 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A246** Support virtual queue via app (theme parks) and kiosk/wristband scan (water parks) *(Softlabs Team · High · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 7 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*
- **A290** Build redemption tickets/rewards, card lifecycle, live monitoring and self-service kiosk *(Softlabs Team · Medium · Not started → 30 Sep: Closed, Moved to OpenProject (S13: build) · 11 Sep 2026 · workshop tracker)*

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*

- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*

- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P05 Guest Kiosk

- Allam: water-park guests rarely carry phones, so a kiosk at the ride lets a guest scan their wristband to book a queue slot and get a return time, then scan the wristband again to enter. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.14 Virtual Queue - Multi-Venue Applicability · DI-677)*
- Face enrollment via mobile app, website, POS, self-service kiosk, or at the turnstile itself (scan the ticket, then look at the reader on first use), covering e.g. B2B/reseller tickets. Re-enrollment and fallback to QR/RFID if face fails at the gate. *(agreed · MoM 2 Sep 2026, 4.10 Facial Recognition - Face Pass, Face Tag & Enrollment · DI-641)*
- Top-up rules set minimum and maximum amounts per transaction; channel/funding-source mapping restricts which payment methods each channel offers (e.g. cash top-up on-site only, not online), so each channel's top-up screen offers only its allowed methods. *(client request · MoM 27 Aug 2026, 4.5 Funding, Top-Up & Reload Management · DI-517)*
- Confirmed: a guest always books a product or package — never a resource (a specific room, vehicle or instructor by itself) directly — on every sales channel, including the guest/mobile app; the product's configuration determines which resources are booked behind the scenes. *(agreed · MoM 26 Aug 2026, 4.10 Guest-Facing Behaviour & Configuration Q&A; 5. Key Decisions · DI-502)*
- Kiosks are guest-facing: white-labelled to the client's branding like the guest website, while keeping a kiosk-specific layout. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-298)*
- Ticketing, F&B and retail share one cart and checkout, one unified receipt and one QR/wristband per customer — no separate receipts or wristbands per product line. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 7. Retail — Cart and Inventory · DI-293)*
- A single cart/order must take mixed purchases (e.g. family tickets plus gift vouchers) with one unified checkout and identity capture. *(agreed · MoM 5 Aug 2026, 7. Sales Channels, Pricing & Cart · DI-141)*
- Allam: the cashier design must work consistently across all cashier device types: POS terminals, tablets, iPads and kiosks. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 3. UX Design Approach Discussion · DI-101)*
- Selling a capacity-based product (e.g. seat-assigned tickets) while offline is blocked with a clear notification, never allowed through or silently failing; non-capacity products stay sellable offline. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 11. Offline Functionality Scope · DI-074)*

### In P05 · Sell

- A guest is not repeatedly re-offered something already declined (e.g. a fast pass rejected three times), and an offer ignored online is not re-presented on another channel, e.g. at POS after the guest bought it there. *(agreed · MoM 21 Sep 2026, 4.6 Personalized Offer Delivery & Omni-Channel Orchestration · DI-962)*
- Navigation depends on ticket type: admission has no date/time and goes straight to quantity/cart; dated asks date only; timed asks date then time; seated asks date, then time, then seat. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 8. Ticket Flow Variations by Product Type · DI-116)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
