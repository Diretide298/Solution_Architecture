## Who this is for

**staff on web.** Everything below is how you know what is
true. **None of it is the subject.** The subject is the person in front of the screen and the one
thing they came to do.

## What to build

**A working surface, not a drawing of one.** Two references, both built from these same sources:

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html` — 54 screens in one navigable file, 133 animations,
  a live seat map, a five-stage payment flow. **This is the bar for finish.**
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html` — the client-approved POS build. **This is the bar for operator density.**

`sources/designs/ticvai-motion-and-interaction.md` names every mechanism in them. Open them and
match their depth. Do not describe them, read them.

## The one rule that outranks the rest

**Nothing in this bundle may appear as text a user can read.** Not an operation id, not a schema
field name, not a permission key, not a screen id, not a file path, not a finding reference.

A homepage that prints `getTenantAppStatus → listProducts` under its header, or labels a column
`venueId · scopePath`, has published its own homework. It happened on `WEB-001`: four products on
sale and not a single price on the page, because the build rendered what `listProducts` returns
instead of what a guest wants — a photo, a name, a price, and a way to book.

**The test: would the person this screen is for understand every word on it?** If a line would
confuse them, it is spec leakage, not design. `bindsTo` tells you what data to invent
convincingly. It is never a caption.

## What is in this folder

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `BUNDLE.md` | **The one file to hand a design session.** This brief; then **Screen by screen**, a full specification of each screen (what the user enters and picks, what it shows and produces, every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it in the meetings, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references and an acceptance checklist); then what applies to the whole batch; then the raw data. |
| `screens.json` | Every field of every screen in the batch, as the package holds it. `machine` is what a screen is *in the middle of*; `overlays` is what opens over it and what closing it does; `navigation.transitions` is how you leave, with `carries` naming the state that travels. |
| `operations.json` | Method, path, parameters, request and response schema for every operation these screens call. Write fetches against these; do not invent endpoints. |
| `schemas.json` | The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here — a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one. |

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Every control that can be refused must be gated.** 1 permissions apply here:
  `CASE_MANAGE`. A control nobody can use must say so,
  not sit enabled and fail.
- **This shell is online only.** None of these operations is served offline here, whatever it can do on a shell that keeps a store.
- **Do not invent an operation.** If a screen needs something `operations.json` does not have, that
  is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible endpoint.
- **`entryState.params` is what the screen must be given.** A screen that renders without them is
  the empty-state bug, not the happy path.
- **How input should be, how output should be.** Each screen's block in `BUNDLE.md` says, field by
  field, the control, whether it is required, its default, its limits and allowed values, its format
  and its error; and, element by element, what is shown and in what format, what each action
  produces and where the user goes next. Draw exactly that.

## The processes these screens belong to

Written by the owner of each process (`handoff/design-notes/`). Read before any screen: it says how the process runs end to end and which words the screens must use.

### Platform Foundation (identity, roles and security; tenancy, venues and devices; platform operations; subscription and licensing; approval workflows; developer portal and public API; digital asset management)

Platform Foundation is everything the apps stand on. Five apps each have one door: the guest app and website (WEB-016, GST-042: a six-digit code to email or mobile, a password, Apple or Google, UAE Pass; never enterprise SSO), the till (POS-000: employee number and PIN, recent operators as tiles; the kitchen display is the same app), the staff handheld and scanner (EMP-001, SCN-001), Venue Management (SUP-001, the single door for the back office P08, the CMS P13, analytics P16 and the support desk P12) and TICVAI Control (ADM-001 for TICVAI's own platform operators, PTR-001 for partner users; the developer portal P14 and the sign-up P17 belong to this app too). A second factor is required by permission, not by role or device: ROLE_MANAGE, LEDGER_APPROVE and every PLATFORM_* permission, plus any the tenant adds; so a cashier never sees it and a platform operator always does. The factor is an authenticator app with an emailed code as fallback; five wrong codes lock step-up for the lockout minutes, never permanently. Guests get two-step verification only at a venue that switched it on. One person holds one session per workstation: a second sign-in is refused and only a supervisor ends the other session. Several roles mean a role prompt; one role goes straight in. The workstation decides the Sale Board, hardware and till identity, never what a person may do. Sensitive actions (refund approval, journal approval, credential reset, partner credit, commission rules, opening a platform-staff grant and 17 more) demand a fresh step-up on the operation itself, asked in place in the action's confirmation; the tenant may raise the strength, never remove it. Permission outcomes are three, never one word: self-authorised (proceeds, audited), escalated (a supervisor PIN in place), refused (the denied state, naming the permission); a missing permission is never an empty table, and a record outside the person's venues is "not found", indistinguishable from absent. The hierarchy is binding (tenant, brand, region, venue, department, sub-department, workstation; outlet beside department for F&B and retail); region owns currency, decimals, time zone, date format and fiscal year; configuration resolves nearest-ancestor across tenant, region and venue (outlet for F&B and retail), venue is the floor and a workstation is assigned a profile, never configured; every configuration screen says which level it writes and what it inherits. Venue Management is one tenant-level surface filtering across the venues in the session's scope. TICVAI's Console runs outside every cell: a platform operator picks a tenant and opens a time-boxed, audited platform-staff grant (with step-up) before any tenant action, and the tenant sees every action in its audit log (ADM-412 is the reference implementation). Approval workflows record authorisations and never perform the action; the requester cannot approve their own request; a venue may tighten and never loosen a rule from above; in-flight …

### Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers)

Customer & marketing is how a venue knows its guests and talks to them. There is ONE guest profile per person across ticketing, F&B and retail, so a guest who books online and later dines is the same profile (DI-339). A profile needs at least an email or a mobile, never neither (DI-372). Profiles are created by registration, by guest checkout, or by staff at a till or desk. Repeat guest checkouts with the same verified email or phone attach to the same profile automatically (DI-941, R120 default). Two records that might be the same person are NEVER merged automatically: the guest is asked to confirm, and an admin review queue runs alongside (DI-377). Each candidate shows why it matched; the record that loses is superseded, not deleted; consent takes the narrower of the two positions (DI-808). Around the profile sit three things that must never be confused. CONSENT is what the law allows: per purpose and per channel, append-only, with the notice version and the source (recordConsent). It is Given, Withdrawn or Not asked. A SUBSCRIPTION is what the guest asked to receive, e.g. a newsletter list (MarketingSubscription). A PREFERENCE is what they like: table, dietary, accessibility (updateGuestPreferences). An anonymous visitor's cookie decision is recorded against a device key (recordDeviceConsent) and attaches to the guest when they sign in (claimDeviceConsent). Marketing consent at GUEST CHECKOUT is an open client question, and the design follows its default: an unticked opt-in beside the terms, one per channel and purpose. It is recorded with source "checkout" against the order and the verified contact, and nothing is sent without it. Whether that is sufficient consent under PDPL is the client DPO's call (M18-15 (audit R-M18-15), DI-954, DI-940). Marketing reads profiles through SEGMENTS (rules, evaluated when used) and static LISTS (imported). It reaches guests by CAMPAIGNS (one send to an audience) and JOURNEYS (automations started by an event, with waits and branches). Journeys may offer only pre-configured offers, never a free-typed discount (MoM 2026-08-20 4.6). Everything goes through ONE communications module that every other module uses (MoM 2026-08-31 4.6). Consent and suppression are applied at send time, and the number excluded, with the reasons, is reported before anything goes out (launchCampaign). Transactional messages (tickets, receipts, queue calls, case replies) do not need marketing consent and must never carry marketing. LOYALTY pays for spend: points, tiers, rewards and expiry. GAMIFICATION pays for behaviour: challenges, badges, streaks, referrals and leaderboards (createChallenge). A guest reads their own loyalty position (getLoyaltyPosition). A till, the back office or support reads a named guest's (getGuestLoyalty, or identifyGuest at a till). SERVICE: one Case object covers lost property, complaints, questions, accessibility and refund requests (CaseKind). A guest raises one with raiseMyCase, which needs the connection …

## The screens

Each has a full block in `BUNDLE.md` (*Screen by screen*). Inputs and outputs count fields; requirements are matrix rows; meeting inputs are the ones naming the screen (the module and platform ones are below); white label says whether the tenant's brand reaches it (guest) or it sets the brand (configures).

| id | name | block | inputs | outputs | states | requirements | meeting inputs | tracker | white label | wireframe |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `SUP-001` | Venue Management Sign In | A | 16 | 51 | 10 | 6 | 1 | 0 | — | notStarted (generated) |
| `SUP-003` | Availability & Routing Settings | D | 6 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | — | notStarted (generated) |

---

## Screen by screen

**One block per screen, in the order to build them.** Each says what the user enters (every control, with its rules), what the screen shows and produces (every field, with its format; every action, with what it returns and the errors to draw), every state, who may do what, the requirements it meets, what the client said about it, the tracker items, what the tenant configures, the references, and an acceptance checklist. **Everything in a block is for you, never for the screen**: no id, field name, operation or permission key may appear as text.

### `SUP-001` Venue Management Sign In

**The one door into Venue Management (back office, CMS, analytics and the support desk): username and password or the tenant's SSO, the authentication code only for a person whose permissions demand it, a role choice when several are held, then the first section the role may see.**

**What the spec says about it.** **Rebuilt as a sign-in form on 2 October 2026 (CHG-DOOR-002/003; Chinmay, 2 October 2026: fix the Block A blockers now).** It was generated as a list over active sessions, MFA methods and SSO providers with Force logout and Revoke all sessions on the door, which a person who is not yet signed in can never use (platform-foundation process notes). The sequence is the same on every staff and partner door: credentials (or the organisation's SSO) -> the authentication code only when a permission demands it (R135) -> the role prompt when several roles are held (ADR-0003) -> the landing. Managing sessions moved to the staff directory (BO-053); managing MFA methods stays on each app's own security or profile screen. **Block A** (CHG-DOOR-004): Block A's Venue Management screens (BO-084, BO-085, BO-124 and the setup screens) cannot be tested end to end without this door, so the plan's Block A closure now takes the door of every app it touches. **Generalised on 10 September 2026 from `Agent Login`**: it is the only door of an application of over 1,300 screens (P08, P12, P13, P16), and `implementation.app` stays `venue-support-web`, the build unit `check-frontend` validates against.

Username and password (or the tenant's SSO where configured), the authentication code only for people holding a permission in the MFA list (ROLE_MANAGE, LEDGER_APPROVE or tenant-added), then a role choice if several, then the venue context from the session's scope. It must not look like an "agent login".

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Shown**

**Sign in with your organisation** (card list, from `listSsoProviders`): One button per identity provider the tenant configured; **absent, not disabled, when there is none.** Read before sign-in, unauthenticated. When a provider `isEnforced` for this person, the password field is hidden and only this remains.

|---|---|---|
| Display name | text | — |
| Protocol | chip: Oidc, Saml2 | — |
| Is enforced | yes / no (icon or chip) | True disables password login for principals covered by this provider. |

**Finishing sign-in with your organisation** (progress indicator, from `completeSsoAuthorization`): On the provider's redirect back (`code` and `state` from the redirect, never typed). Returns the same `LoginResponse` as `login`, so the second factor and the role prompt follow exactly as below. 403: the provider proved who this is and no group maps to a role in this tenant, which grants nothing.

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | Checking the credential. The form stays visible and disabled. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | **Nobody signed in** - the normal state of a door. The form offers username and password and, where the tenant configured one, its SSO. The copy says Venue Management, never agent login. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Identity could not be reached. **Says so rather than saying the password is wrong**, and keeps what was typed. |
| Denied (`?state=denied`) | The credential does not match, or the account is locked. One message for both, with the attempts left before the lock; a locked account says when to try again. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Signed in, and the person holds no role in this app. Says who at the tenant grants access; distinct from a wrong password. A door has no permission of its own to name, because the person is not signed in until it succeeds. |
| Empty, no results (`?state=emptyNoResults`) | Never shown: `listSsoProviders` takes no filter; a tenant with no identity provider shows no SSO buttons at all, and the form is the whole door. |
| Session held (`?state=sessionHeld`) | `login` answered 409: this person already holds a session elsewhere (audit R184, ADR-0004). Says where and since when; only a holder of SESSION_FORCE_LOGOUT ends it, on the staff directory (BO-053), and signing in never ends it by itself. |
| MFA required (`?state=mfaRequired`) | **Signed in, not yet through.** The principal holds a permission that requires MFA (ROLE_MANAGE, LEDGER_APPROVE, any PLATFORM_* permission, or one the tenant added), so the screen calls `createMfaChallenge` (`action: signIn`) and asks for the authentication code; `verifyMfaChallenge` completes the sign-in. **Email me a code instead** is the fallback. Five wrong codes lock step-up for the policy's lockout minutes and the screen says until when (audit R135, R126). A person without such a … |
| MFA enrolment required (`?state=mfaEnrolmentRequired`) | **First sign-in, no method yet.** A person who requires MFA and has no active method enrols the authenticator app (email as the fallback) with `enrolMfaMethod`, confirms it with the first code (`verifyMfaEnrolment`), sees the recovery codes once, then continues to the code step (audit R135, R126 (5)). |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | Not available, and the offline banner says why: signing in needs a connection. |
| Validation and conflict | the form keeps what was entered and marks the problem: 400 Validation failed; 409 An active session already exists for this principal on another device. Per §3.1.3 the new login is refused.; 422 A kind the caller may not enrol. Staff use `totp`, with `emailOtp` as the fallback (audit R126); a guest the same (rev 3 GAP-B1).; 422 The new credential fails the password policy, or matches the current one or any of the previous … |

#### Edge cases to draw

- **A temporary password after a reset**: A new password is set before anything else (changeOwnCredential), the last 5 cannot be reused. *(source: contracts/spine/identity.yaml#changeOwnCredential; R132)*

#### Consistency with other screens

- Match `ADM-001`: Same form and second-factor step.
- Match `POS-000`: Same refusal wording for a held session.

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
user:
  name: Fatima Al Mansoori
  username: fatima.almansoori
  roles:
  - Venue Manager
  venues:
  - AquaCove Abu Dhabi
  mfa: false
admin:
  name: Aisha Al Nuaimi
  username: aisha.alnuaimi
  roles:
  - Tenant Admin
  mfa: true
```

#### Permissions

- `login` → no permission · anonymous, partner
- `listSsoProviders` → no permission · anonymous, partner
- `startSsoAuthorization` → no permission · anonymous
- `completeSsoAuthorization` → no permission · anonymous
- `createMfaChallenge` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `verifyMfaChallenge` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `enrolMfaMethod` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `verifyMfaEnrolment` → no permission · staff, partner, guest
- `selectRole` → no permission · staff, partner
- `changeOwnCredential` → no permission · staff, partner
- `getCurrentSession` → no permission · staff, partner

**A refused user sees:** Signed in, and the person holds no role in this app. Says who at the tenant grants access; distinct from a wrong password. A door has no permission of its own to name, because the person is not signed in until it succeeds.

#### Requirements it meets

6 rows of the client's requirements matrix (`sources/requirements/Ticvai_matrix_20260621_2.xlsx`) trace to this screen's operations or data (`handoff/traceability.json`). The matrix carries no priority; the screen's block is its delivery priority.

| Ref | Requirement (shortened) | Domain | Verdict | Via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1.5 | The system should have the option to be used by several waiters at the same time. | F&B & Guest Management | CONTRACTED | `login` |
| 5.8.2 | The system should only allow one session per user. | F&B & Guest Management | CONTRACTED | `login` |
| 7.1.16 | The system shall support MFA using Email OTP, SMS OTP, Authenticator Apps, and future supported authentication mechanisms. | F&B POS | CONTRACTED | `enrolMfaMethod` |
| 7.1.4 | The system should be able to have a login override option for the supervisor level in order to login to the POS if the need arises and the previous user has not logged out. | F&B POS | CONTRACTED | `selectRole` |
| 3.3.28 | Authorization Caching - System shall support caching of authorization decisions. | Admission and Access | CONTRACTED | `getCurrentSession` |
| 7.1.50 | Cache authorization decisions securely to improve performance while ensuring policy changes invalidate outdated cache entries. | F&B POS | CONTRACTED | `getCurrentSession` |

#### Client meeting inputs

For this screen, newest first. An **Open question** is built to the default it states. Where an item disagrees with the fields above, the item wins.

- Access loads automatically at login on POS and web/admin. A user with one role logs straight in; a user with several roles (e.g. admin, cashier, supervisor, manager) is prompted to choose which role to use. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 4. Multiple Roles per User and Role Switching · DI-249)*

Also apply: 7 for all of P12, 29 for every app (section *Design inputs from the client meetings* below).

#### Workshop task tracker

No tracker row concerns this screen; the rows for its platform are listed once, below.

### `SUP-003` Availability & Routing Settings

**Set yourself available, away or offline, and see how work is routed to you.**

| | |
|---|---|
| App · platform | TICVAI Venue Management · P12 Venue Support (web) |
| Module | Access & Availability · wave 3 · needs the `marketing` module |
| Block | Block D · task APP-SUPPORT-SUP-003 |
| Who uses it | venue staff holding `CASE_MANAGE` (1 configure) |
| Device and orientation | This is the back office on a desktop browser, 1440 wide: a left navigation rail with the module sections, a top bar with the venue switcher, and the screen in the main area. · LTR and RTL · light, dark theme |
| Pattern | configEditor (compact density): the screen declares only writes (`setAgentAvailability`) and no read of a population — it is settings, not a list |
| Offline | online only |
| Opens with | nothing: it opens on its own |
| Route | `/general/availability-and-routing-settings` |

**What the spec says about it.** States derived from the screen pattern on 17 August, not individually considered — sound for a list, a form or a money screen, and worth revisiting where this screen is unusual. Purpose derived from the screen name and its operations on 17 August, not from a requirement.

**Known gaps.**  Open: No contract — agent routing not modelled

**From the Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers) process.** The agent sets their own availability (available, busy, away, offline), how many conversations they take at once, and which queues they serve. Routing depends on it, and availability expires on its own so an agent who forgets to go offline is not routed work.

**Fixed on main** (the package already carries these; draw what it says): Purpose reads "Change how availability behaves here, and see which level the current value came from". (CHG-WIR-006).

#### Inputs: what the user enters or picks

**On the screen**

| Control | Drawn as | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules | Format | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| State | select field | — | — | — | — | Required. | — |
| Max concurrent | number field | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Queue ids | multi select | — | — | — | — | — | — |

**Sent by *Save agent availability*** (`setAgentAvailability`; no form is declared, so these are filled from the screen or collected inline)

| Field | Control | Required | Default | Allowed values, rules and conditions | Format | Helper text | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| State `state` | radio group | required | — | Available · Busy · Away · Offline | — | — | `setAgentAvailability` body |
| Max concurrent `maxConcurrent` | number field | optional | — | — | — | How many conversations this agent takes at once. Three is not three times one. | `setAgentAvailability` body |
| Queues `queueIds` | multi-picker: choose queues | optional | — | — | — | — | `setAgentAvailability` body |

**Rules for these inputs** (from the Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **State**: Available, busy, away, offline; shown in the top bar of every Support Console screen. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#setAgentAvailability)*
- **Max concurrent**: 1 to the venue's maximum; three is not three times one, so a hint shows the agent's average handling time. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#setAgentAvailability)*
- **Queues**: Only queues the agent's skills allow. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#listServiceQueues)*

#### Outputs: what the screen shows and produces

**Actions and what each produces**

| Action | Calls | Sends | On success returns | Errors to show | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Save agent availability (primary button) | `setAgentAvailability` PUT `/agent-availability` | inline | AgentAvailability | — | — |

**Rules for what is shown** (from the Customer & Marketing (CRM, guest profiles, consent, segments, campaigns, journeys, loyalty, gamification, cases, voice of customer, waivers) process; these refine the tables above and win where they differ)

- **Expiry**: "Available until 18:00 (end of shift)" from the state's expiry. *(source: contracts/satellite/marketing-crm.yaml#/components/schemas/AgentAvailability)*

**Where the user goes next**

- → `SUP-001` Venue Management Sign In: *Agent Login*

#### States

| State | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Loading (`?state=loading`) | The saved availability routing settings. |
| Error (`?state=error`) | Could not load. Names which read failed and leaves the availability routing settings untouched. |
| Empty, first run (`?state=emptyFirstRun`) | No availability routing settings configured. The form opens empty and `setAgentAvailability` saves the first one; it says what the platform does in the meantime. |
| Permission denied (`?state=emptyNoAccess`) | Shown when the caller lacks `CASE_MANAGE`, which `setAgentAvailability` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question. |
| Offline (`?state=offline`) | online only |

#### Sample data for the mock-up

Seed the screen with these (realistic, in the venue's world). They outrank invented data; the schema outranks them where a value would not validate.

```yaml
agent:
  name: Aisha Rahman
  state: Available
  max: 3
  queues:
  - Reservations
  - General
  until: 1080
```

#### Permissions

- `setAgentAvailability` → `CASE_MANAGE` (configure) · staff

**A refused user sees:** Shown when the caller lacks `CASE_MANAGE`, which `setAgentAvailability` requires, and names that permission. **Never an empty table** — that reads as *there is no data* and sends somebody to support with the wrong question.

#### Requirements it meets

No matrix row traces to this screen's operations or data.

#### Client meeting inputs

## Reference designs and the trackers for this platform

**P12 reference designs** (from `handoff/design-batches/apps/5-venue-management/README.md`)

- `sources/designs/TICVAI_POS_Terminal_client_approved.html`: for operator density.
- `sources/designs/TICVAI_Mobile.dc.html`: for finish and motion.

**Design Vision Book rules that apply** (`sources/designs/Ticvai_Design_Vision_Book_v1_1.pdf`): DI-021, DI-022, DI-023, DI-024, DI-025, DI-027, DI-028, DI-029, DI-032, DI-033, DI-034, DI-036, DI-037, DI-038, DI-039, DI-040, DI-042, DI-044, DI-045, DI-046, DI-047, DI-048, DI-049, DI-050, DI-051 (each is in the design inputs below).

## Design inputs from the client meetings

**What the client asked for in the meetings and design reviews, for these screens.** Apply every item. They are the client's own requirements and they are later than the reference files: where a reference design or a screen's fields disagree with an item here, the item wins. Newest first; where two items disagree, the newer one wins (anything a later meeting replaced is already left out). An **Open question** is not settled: build the default it states and keep it easy to change. The text in brackets is for traceability and, like everything else in this bundle, never appears on a screen.

### Everywhere, on every app

- Allam (platform-wide requirement): every calendar throughout the platform, not just maintenance, must support day, week and month views, with the day view further broken down by hour from a defined start hour through the day. *(agreed · MoM 17 Sep 2026, 4.2 Preventive Maintenance Planning · DI-907)*
- Minimise the number of separate screens an end user navigates: consolidate related information wherever it can reasonably be shown together, rather than mirroring every workshop board as its own screen. *(agreed · MoM 7 Sep 2026, 4.10 Screen consolidation / 5. Key Decisions · DI-671)*
- Region-configurable tax on pre-discount price (e.g. Egypt: AED 100 ticket with 20% off is paid at AED 80 but taxed on AED 100). Rounding must support up to three decimal places without dropping the third decimal where the currency requires it. *(agreed · MoM 1 Sep 2026, 4.5 Taxes, Fees & Price Calculation · DI-598)*
- "Powered by TICVAI" is shown consistently across staff and guest-facing surfaces. *(agreed · MoM 14 Aug 2026, 8. POS / Kiosk Branding · DI-297)*
- Full multi-language support (Arabic and others such as Chinese) consistent with the agreed i18n/RTL architecture. *(agreed · MoM 10 Aug 2026, 4.7 Account Creation, Localisation & Multi-Currency · DI-210)*
- The reference system is a functional reference only: its dated UI/UX is not to be replicated; TICVAI delivers equivalent depth with a modern, AI-friendly, easy-to-configure experience. *(agreed · MoM 7 Aug 2026, 23. Reference System Access & Documentation · DI-186)*
- Direction: modern, minimalistic, spacious, cross-device designs that still convey a sense of place (venue or park); Softlabs proposes two to three enhanced visual concepts for TICVAI to steer. *(agreed · MoM 3 Aug 2026, 11. Design Alignment & Team Input · DI-126)*
- Languages: English and Arabic at minimum, with Russian, Spanish and Mandarin. *(agreed · MoM 31 Jul 2026, 13. Internationalization & Localization · DI-080)*
- Clarity first; reduce cognitive load (simple layouts, familiar patterns); consistency ("Use the system. Do not recreate."); accessibility; hierarchy (guide attention with contrast, spacing and visual weight); feedback (every action has a clear response). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Design Principles in Action · DI-051)*
- Standard components: search bar with Cmd+K; tabs (Overview, Events, Sales, Reports); pagination; badges (New, Pending, Sold Out, Completed); toggle (Off/On); dropdown; removable chip ("VIP x"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - Example UI Components · DI-050)*
- Spacing on an 8px base grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80. Border radius scale 4, 8, 12, 16, 24px, consistent across the platform. Soft shadows: sm 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.05); md 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,.08); lg 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,.10); xl 0 20px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.14). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 6. Spacing / 7. Border Radius / 8. Shadows · DI-049)*
- Icons: line style, outline, 2px stroke, round corners, clean and consistent. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 5. Icons · DI-048)*
- Component principles: clarity first; consistent spacing on an 8px grid; meaningful colour (colours communicate status and guide the user); accessible by design; mobile ready (components adapt across all screen sizes). Components are consistent, flexible, accessible and composable. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Component principles · DI-045)*
- Empty states have a title, one explanatory line and one action: "No events yet / Create your first event to get started / Create Event"; "No data available / We couldn't find anything to show here / Refresh". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Empty States · DI-044)*
- Notification list: status icon, title, one-line detail and relative time (e.g. "Payment received ... 2m ago", "High demand detected ... 10m ago"), with "View all notifications". *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Notifications · DI-042)*
- Forms: label above field; text input, select ("Choose an option"), date picker, toggle, checkbox. Input states: Default, Focused, Filled, Disabled and Error with inline message (e.g. "This field is required"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Forms; 08 Design System (p8) - 4. Inputs · DI-040)*
- Card types: event card (title, date and time, venue, "From 120.00 AED"); KPI card (label, value, delta, "vs last 7 days"); onboarding checklist card ("3 of 6 completed": Create Event, Add Staff, Configure Seating, Connect Payment). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Cards · DI-038)*
- Button hierarchy Primary, Secondary, Tertiary (text) and Icon buttons, each with Default, Hover, Pressed and Disabled states. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Buttons; 08 Design System (p8) - 3. Buttons · DI-036)*
- Regardless of the module a user is working in, the experience should feel like one product, not a collection of separate applications. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 07 Modules Overview (p7) · DI-034)*
- DO: focus on clarity and hierarchy, use clear simple interactive elements, give relevant information at a glance (card example: "Annual Membership / All Venues / 4.4 (388) / BESTSELLER"). DON'T: clutter and overload (e.g. "-10% NEW PROMO AED 450.00 !!! BOOK NOW!!!"), complex forms and flows, hard-to-read data visualisations. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - DO / DON'T · DI-033)*
- Eight principles on every screen: User-Centric, AI-First, Simple & Clear (clean layouts, clear hierarchy, minimal noise), Fast & Efficient (optimised for quick actions), Reliable & Secure (permissions, data protection), Data-Driven (data visual, actionable, easy to understand), Scalable, Consistent (same patterns, components and interactions across the ecosystem). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 05 Design Principles (p5) - Our Design Principles · DI-032)*
- Accessibility: high contrast, readable text, keyboard navigation and inclusive components throughout; WCAG AA standards minimum ("Design for everyone"). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Better Accessibility; 06 Component principles (p6); 08 Design principles in action (p8) · DI-029)*
- AI everywhere: AI insights, recommendations and smart assistance are embedded across the platform, not hidden. AI is not an add-on: it assists, predicts, recommends and automates. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - How TICVAI improves this concept; 05 Design Principles (p5) - 2. AI-First · DI-027)*
- Global Search: prominent, AI-powered search that finds anything, in the top bar with a Cmd+K shortcut (placeholder e.g. "Search events, customers, orders, venues or ask AI..."). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - UI inspiration reference, item 1; 08 Design System (p8) - Search Bar · DI-025)*
- Visual direction: Purposeful (every element has a clear purpose), Consistent (one visual system across all modules and devices), Clear (easy to scan, understand and act on), Modern. Key takeaway: clean, modern, product-first layout with clear hierarchy and minimal visual noise; deep, modern, trustworthy; built for enterprise scale. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) · DI-024)*
- The brand is presented consistently across Web Platform, Mobile App and Admin Portal (and print). Ticvai identity, colours and typography are applied consistently across all screens and devices. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand in action; 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Consistent Branding · DI-023)*
- Copy is Professional, Friendly, Clear, Confident, Concise and Helpful. Avoid jargon, overly technical language, clutter, outdated language and complexity. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand voice · DI-022)*
- Brand personality: Modern, AI-First, Enterprise, Premium, Reliable, Minimal, Scalable, Human-Centred. Visual essence: intelligent and forward-thinking, clean and minimal, trustworthy and secure, modern and timeless, scalable and flexible. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 02 Brand Identity (p2) - Brand personality / Visual essence · DI-021)*
- Arabic is a core requirement, not later localisation: full Arabic RTL across web, mobile, POS, reports, emails, WhatsApp, SMS, notifications, tickets and receipts, and administrative interfaces. *(agreed · MoM 28 Jul 2026, 27. Internationalisation and Arabic Support · DI-019)*

### Across P12 Venue Support

- Decision: RBAC per role, per module, three levels — edit/view, view-only, hidden (e.g. a marketing officer does not see Finance at all) — plus sub-permissions within a module (a CRM role may get Campaigns and Communications but not Journeys). Default role templates, admin-customisable. *(agreed · MoM 20 Aug 2026, 4.7 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC); 5. Key Decisions · DI-387)*
- Client support staff log into TICVAI to view and respond to their own tickets/chats (keeps a full audit trail); adapters to clients' own support systems are phase two. *(agreed · MoM 12 Aug 2026, 10. Customer Support / Chat Integration Approach · DI-257)*
- Typeface Inter (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold). Scale: H1 32/40 Bold, H2 24/32 Semibold, H3 20/28 Semibold, Body 1 16/24 Regular, Body 2 14/20 Regular, Caption 12/16 Regular. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 2. Typography · DI-047)*
- Palette ("modern, trustworthy and accessible"): Primary #0D6EFD, #00B8FF, #00D4C4, #0B1324; Neutral #F7F9FC, #E5E7EB, #9CA3AF, #4B5563, #1F2937. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 08 Design System (p8) - 1. Color Palette · DI-046)*
- Tables: titled card with "View all", columns (e.g. Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status), coloured status badges (Paid, Pending, Refunded) and pagination with "Showing 1 to 5 of 245" and page numbers. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 06 Component Direction (p6) - Tables · DI-039)*
- Primary button spec: height 40px, padding 12px 24px, radius 8px, Inter 14 Semibold, colour #0D6EFD, width auto. *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 09 Deliverables (p9) - Developer Handoff preview · DI-037)*
- Dynamic KPIs, forecasts and real-time insights; role-based dashboards, preferences and smart shortcuts for every user (e.g. greeting "Good morning, Ahmed" on the home screen, p2). *(agreed · Design Vision Book 29 Jul 2026, 03 Visual Direction (p3) - Smarter Data / Personalized Experience · DI-028)*

## Raw data

The same package data the blocks above are built from. `screens.json` is in the folder and not repeated here: every field of it is in the blocks.

### `operations.json`

Method, path, parameters, request and response for every operation these screens call. **Write fetches against these and do not invent an endpoint** — a screen needing something absent here is a finding worth reporting, not a gap to fill with a plausible URL.

### `schemas.json`

The data those operations carry, resolved one level deep. **Seed from these.** The reference prototype hardcodes 57 models and every one corresponds to a schema here; a build that invents its own will disagree with the backend on day one.
